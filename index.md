## Disclaimer

1. Copyrights to [Legend of the Northern Blade](/LNB/) are held by the author, Woo-Gak, and the artist, Hae Min. 

2. Copyrights to [Star Instructor Master Baek](/SIMB/) are held by the author, Ganjajang, and the artist, Oliboli. 

3. Do not take credit or make a profit from our work. Our translations can be read for FREE, with NO ADS. We DO NOT ask for donations.

4. Enjoy reading from what is probably the simplest looking translator's website, because minimalist themes are awesome.

5. Don't bother asking for faster releases since I have a full-time job with frequent overtime. Commenting and liking the chapters does give me more motivation to translate though, which will result in faster releases.
