"Hoo..." Gongson Su exhaled deeply, steadying his nerves as he climbed the stairs to the dueling arena. Although he had done his best to appear calm in front of his White Dragon Manor peers, the butterflies in his stomach were undeniable.

*Hoho, that's quite a crowd.*

The arena was packed to the brim. Gongson Su realized that most of them barely noticed him, but their fleeting glances weighed heavily on him, especially under the stoic gaze of the judges.

Gritting his teeth, Gongson Su forced his legs up each step, when the spectators' whispers reached his ears.

"Hey, isn't that the Elder who fought Cho Maksaeng a few days ago?"

"Yeah, the one who came out on top, but then got jumped by the sore loser."

"Elder! Good luck!"

"You're amazing for your age. Reminds me of my father..."

"Show those young'uns how it's done, Elder!"

"Grandpa! Good luck!"

Gongson Su was taken aback by how many people recognized him, and some even greeted him warmly. Middle-aged and elderly spectators cheered him on, seeing a bit of themselves in him. Children waved enthusiastically, clutching their parents' hands.

*Hoho..*. Gongson Su smiled, feeling his tension ease. Scanning the crowd, his eyes met Baek Suryong's, who winked reassuringly.

"Thank you," Gongson Su whispered, buoyed by the support as he stepped onto the platform.

At the same time, his opponent appeared from the opposite side, eliciting gasps and murmurs from the audience.

"Oh my... I am honored to face the Student Council President," Gongson Su greeted.

Dokgo Jun, the celebrated prodigy of Azure Dragon Academy, stood poised across from him, his demeanor exuding discipline and dignity. "Do you think it unfortunate that you're facing me?" he asked.

"On the contrary," Gongson Su chuckled, brandishing his sword with a grin. "I consider it a stroke of luck. I even prayed for the chance to spar with you," he added, settling into his stance.

And he meant every word. If he was going to fight, he wanted it to be against the best, so that he would have no regrets.

Dokgo Jun eyed him briefly, then said, "I'm sorry, Elder, but I don't think you belong in the Azure Dragon Academy."

"Oh?"

There was no arrogance or disrespect in Dokgo Jun's voice. Rather, his eyes were sincere and his tone was respectful, piquing Gongson Su's curiosity.

"Is that your personal opinion?" Gongson Su asked.

"No, sir."

"Then why?"

"To put it bluntly, you lack the potential to grow as a martial artist."

Namgoong Jaehak and Noh Goonsang, who were judging the duels, immediately stiffened at the unexpected statement.

However, Gongson Su's face remained impassive. "Is that so?"

"There are many talented and promising youths with bright futures. They're the ones who deserve the academy spots."

"Are you saying that I'm not qualified because of my age? That I should give way to the younger generation?"

"I know about your private lessons with Master Baek Suryong."

"Indeed," Gongson Su confirmed, caught off guard by the sudden mention of his teacher.

"Elder, perhaps you're wealthy and fulfilled in other aspects of life, so you've turned to martial arts as a new venture. However, for you, this test is just a pastime, a hobby. For the kids, it's their life's goal."

"You talk as if you know me well."

"I don't, but I know who is more desperate between you and the young hopefuls." Dokgo Jun raised his sword. "You should continue your training with a personal teacher. The Azure Dragon Academy is not a place for hobbies."

"......"

"Withdraw from the exam after this duel."

"What?" Gongson Su's eyes narrowed. He had never planned on attending the academy due to an upcoming imperial summons, but the exam was a crucial personal challenge.

"...Who says desperation wanes with age?" he retorted, tightening his grip on his sword and inching forward. "I reject your offer. I will pass this exam and claim my place at the Azure Dragon Academy."

"......"

As the conversation dragged, impatience rippled through the crowd.

"BOOOOOO!"

"When are they going to fight?"

"Hurry up and start!"

The time for idle talk was over.

Dokgo Jun lowered his sword, his voice carrying a tone of finality. "I'll give you three free strikes. It's the only courtesy I can offer."

Although the words echoed those of Cho Maksaeng a few days ago, they carried a different weight coming from Dokgo Jun. His stance left no openings, and Gongson Su did not look for any. Instead, he closed the gap and his sword slashed down swiftly, only for Dokgo Jun to parry it with an effortless lift of his blade.

*His defense is solid, like an impenetrable wall,* Gongson Su thought as their swords met.

"Two strikes left," Dokgo Jun announced, lifting his sword with calm precision. His eyes revealed no complacency, only confidence.

"Hoo…" Gongson Su took a moment to catch his breath, then retreated several steps before lunging forward again.

*When it comes to inner arts, I have the upper hand, but confident as he is, he won't dodge,* Gongson Su mused. The initial attack was just an attempt to assess Dokgo Jun's strength. Now, the real fight began. Gongson Su's sword hummed with energy, infused with qi, as it cleaved the air like a beam of light.

Like he predicted, Dokgo Jun didn't dodge. The teenager met Gongson Su's strike with his sword, deflecting it aside. The clash of metal resonated as they both spun away, using the motion to ease the force of the blow. Their martial arts uniforms billowed, and dust whirled up from the floor.

"One strike left," Dokgo Jun commented.

"Take this too!" Gongson Su shouted, accelerating his swing by rotating his waist and slashing at Dokgo Jun with renewed vigor. It was his fiercest attack yet.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Sparks scattered as their swords collided repeatedly, sweeping up a storm.

Then, with a low voice, Dokgo Jun launched off the ground, declaring, "That's three strikes. It's over."

Gongson Su watched him soar up, noting the absence of even a single bead of sweat on Dokgo Jun's brow.

"Be careful!" Dokgo Jun called out politely, his sword descending in a straightforward slash.

Gongson Su hoisted his sword with both hands to block.

"Ugh!"

aggAnnoy06

The weight was immense, as if Dokgo Jun wielded a hammer instead of a sword. Gongson Su pushed back with all his might, his legs trembling as he took a step back.

"...Impressive," Dokgo Jun acknowledged, visibly surprised. He had expected that his strike would incapacitate Gongson Su, yet the elder had held firm.

Pale but smiling, Gongson Su replied, "I've trained as if my life depended on it. Quite excessive for a hobby, wouldn't you agree?"

Without warning, Dokgo Jun closed the gap with a powerful thrust that sent Gongson Su skidding back to the edge of the duel platform. A few inches more, and he would have fallen off.

*His sword, like his demeanor, is straightforward. There are no feints or tricks, only strength and skill,* Gongson Su observed.

"Again?" Dokgo Jun's eyebrows twitched. Since he had not held back, he had expected to push Gongson Su out of the ring. However, even though he was bleeding, his opponent stood firm.

"Hah... Impressive," Gongson Su remarked, wiping the blood from his hand onto the ground and tightening his grip on his sword. The pain was sharp, but he shrugged it off and grinned at Dokgo Jun. "Now, it's starting to get fun."

"……"

"This time, I'll go first," Gongson Su announced.

However, the flow of the battle remained unchanged. Gongson Su attacked, Dokgo Jun deflected, and Gongson Su stumbled back, struggling to maintain his hold on his sword. Each time he nearly fell, he pushed himself back up and lunged forward once more.

"Why aren't you giving up?" Dokgo Jun asked, bewildered. He was wielding the Nine Swords of Dokgo, a technique known for overwhelming opponents, but Gongson Su showed no fear despite his battered state.

"Because I, too, am desperate," Gongson Su declared.

Dokgo Jun paused, stunned. He had assumed that martial arts was just a pastime for Gongson Su, but seeing the elder's fervent struggle, he finally realized how mistaken he was. "I take back what I said earlier," he finally conceded.

"Hmm?" Gongson Su raised an eyebrow.

Dokgo Jun, known for his stubbornness, bowed his head and admitted, "I apologize. To make amends, I will show you my best technique."

"That doesn't sound like good news to me, but bring it on, I'll face you with everything I've got," Gongson Su chuckled, even as sweat dripped down his forehead and his hands trembled.

Nodding, Dokgo Jun swung his sword. For a moment, Gongson Su felt as if the enormous blade filled his entire vision.

*Impressive,* he admired, even as he swung his own blade with all his strength. It met Dokgo Jun's, but was quickly overpowered. Slowly, almost as if in slow-motion, his sword split in two.

aggAnnoy09

CRACK!

Gongson Su looked at the remaining half of his sword with a bittersweet smile, then bowed slightly and said, "Hoho, I've lost."

The crowd erupted into applause and cheers, but Gongson Su barely heard it. Instead, his mind conjured images of the young warriors he had once admired.

"It was a good duel," Dokgo Jun acknowledged, returning the gesture.

"It was indeed. I will never forget what happened today," Gongson Su replied, looking up at the sky.

Dark clouds gathered, hinting at rain, and the world seemed to blur around him.

Thus concluded the brief adventure of a 65-year-old novice martial artist.

[Prepare.]

Just then, the assassins moved in unison.
