"Ticket holders, please proceed to the waiting seats behind your designated arena!"

"Parents and acquaintances, make your way to the spectators' seats!"

"Opponents will be randomly selected through a draw! Even I don't know who it will be! So stop asking me about that!"

"Quiet, please! Quiet, please! Can we have some quiet here?!"

Vice Principal Kwak Cheolwoo, the overseer of the afternoon's exams at Azure Dragon Academy, found himself constantly shouting to manage the massive crowd pouring into the grounds. His day was proving to be hectic.

When it was finally break time, Kwak Cheolwoo sank into a chair, exhausted. "Where the heck is the Headmaster when you need him?!" he grumbled, thumping the armrest with his hand.

The job of managing the crowd was the Headmaster's. Yet, earlier that day, the Headmaster had briefly appeared, made a quick comment, and left.

> "Vice Principal, I have some matters to attend to, so I'll leave the crowd control to you for a while."
>
> "…Yes?"

*How dare the Headmaster speak so informally to me? And he even dumped his work on me as I was his subordinate! Would this happen in any of the other Five Great Academies?*

Such disrespect was unique to the Azure Dragon Academy. Unfortunately, despite his high rank, Kwak Cheolwoo didn't match up to Mae Geuklyom in seniority, martial arts, or achievements. Thus, he found himself unable to retort and was stuck working non-stop until now.

"Just you wait. One day, I'll ensure that nasty old man is ousted from the academy..." Kwak Cheolwoo muttered through gritted teeth.

"Are you talking about me, by any chance?"

aggAnnoy11

"Ah!" Startled, Kwak Cheolwoo jumped at the sound of Noh Goonsang's voice coming from behind him. "Principal! You nearly gave me a heart attack!"

"You look like you could use some help, so I thought I'd come by."

"Help would be appre... Oh, Senior Blue Sky Sword King is here too."

"It's been a while. Need a hand from this old man?"

*Old man, my ass...* Kwak Cheolwoo thought, staring at Namgoong Jaehak's youthful face. Still, even though he could ask Noh Goonsang for help, he didn't dare impose his will on Namgoong Jaehak, a member of the revered Ten Kings.

"Is there something on my face?" Namgoong Jaehak asked.

Feeling a twinge of envy, Kwak Cheolwoo quickly bowed his head. "No, I've got it covered here. You two enjoy the event."

"Hoho, we'll leave you to it then."

"Keep up the hard work."

The two returned to the VIP seats, surveying the ten duel arenas prepared for the exam. The stands were already filled to the brim, the air electric with the candidates' nervous energy and the robust cheers from their supporters.

"Do these events make you feel like you're reliving your youth, like the old days when you were a spry young martial artist?" Noh Goonsang asked.

aggAnnoy04

"I can't say they do," Namgoong Jaehak replied plainly.

Noh Goonsang looked admiringly at his friend. "That's probably because you still have that youthful vigor. Sigh, losing your sentimentality to rejuvenation is a real shame. The daily reliving of old memories is a pleasure for only us old-timers."

"So you're against rejuvenation?"

"Would you mind sharing your secret?"

"Ohoho."

"Hohoho."

"By the way, it seems busier than usual. Is it always this crowded?" Namgoong Jaehak observed, scanning the bustling Azure Dragon Academy.

"No, it's unusually busy this year."

The Azure Dragon Academy had been performing poorly at the Heavenly Martial Festival for the past decade, leading to dwindling spectator numbers at the entrance exams. However, this year had brought a significant uptick in attendance.

"I suppose the main reason is you," Noh Goonsang suggested.

Indeed, many had come to see Namgoong Jaehak, one of the Ten Kings, known as the Blue Sky Sword King.

aggAnnoy04

"And the second reason?"

"We're candidates to win the Heavenly Martial Festival this year," Noh Goonsang quipped, his mind on a recent bold claim.

> "At this year's Heavenly Martial Festival, I will lead the Azure Dragon Academy to victory."

Baek Suryong's audacious declaration had resonated throughout the city and the murim. Although it was met with skepticism, it undeniably had a positive impact. Perhaps influenced by his proclamation, this year's batch of applicants at Azure Dragon Academy seemed exceptionally gifted.

"Just you watch. The Azure Dragon Academy will turn the tides at this year's Heavenly Martial Festival," Noh Goonsang remarked, looking back at Namgoong Jaehak.

In the past, Namgoong Jaehak would have scoffed at such optimism, but not this time. "It might just happen," he chuckled.

"Oho?"

Just then, Gongson Su and his entourage made their entrance. Seeing Namgoong Jaehak's gaze lingering on the thee of them, Noh Goonsang raised an eyebrow.

"I heard a single instructor taught those three," Namgoong Jaehak remaked.

"Really? That man's name has reached even your ears?"

"Not yet, so enlighten me."

"His name is Baek Suryong, and he's one of our new instructors. Ah, there he is." Noh Goonsang pointed out Baek Suryong, who was patrolling the stands with other temporary instructors like Ak Yeonho.

Namgoong Jaehak studied him intently. "Hmm. Doesn't look all that impressive. Handsome, though... Maybe..."

aggAnnoy14

"Don't. Just don't."

"...What?"

With a stern look, Noh Goonsang lowered his voice and warned, "Don't even think about stealing him. He's our academy's teacher."

"Ahem. What are you talking about? I haven't said anything," Namgoong Jaehak feigned innocence, though he had indeed considered approaching Baek Suryong.

"Just a request, please don't."

"Alright, if you insist..." Namgoong Jaehak relented.

Noh Goonsang's face relaxed. "Wise decision. You wouldn't want to embarrass yourself."

"Was that a joke?"

"Hohohoho!"

With Noh Goonsang's mix of jest and earnestness, Namgoong Jaehak found it hard to gauge his sincerity. 

*But that makes it all the more intriguing.*

Namgoong Jaehak's attention remained fixed on Baek Suryong for a good long while.

{sep}

"Someone's staring at me so hard I feel like they've peeled a layer of skin off my face," Baek Suryong remarked.

aggAnnoy01

Ak Yeonho immediately glanced around excitedly, asking, "Which lady is it this time? Your popularity is off the charts..."

"It's not a woman," Baek Suryong sighed. If it had been, he wouldn't be sweating bullets like this.

*As expected from the Blue Sky Sword King, said to be the strongest in the current murim. Even at this distance, his stare is enough to make my skin tingle. Though, I really wish he'd stop watching me.*

The moment Baek Suryong realized that Namgoong Jaehak was observing him, he became extra cautious. After all, martial masters at the level of the Ten Kings were basically living natural disasters. To anger or interest them was exceedingly dangerous, and with his current abilities, Baek Suryong couldn't afford to take any risks.

*If he ever finds out that I've mastered the Heaven Defying Divine Art... No, I don't even want to imagine what'll happen. I should prioritize staying under the radar, especially since Namgoong Jaehak might recognize the Blood Cult's martial arts after fighting them fifty years ago.*

aggAnnoy09

"If it's not a woman, then... Don't tell me? Well, with a face like Hyung-nim's, it's no wonder people don't discriminate by gender," Ak Yeonho said.

BONK!

"You've got that right," Baek Suryong chuckled, smacking Ak Yeonho on the back of the head for his cheekiness. He thought about looking for somewhere to hide, but luckily, as the exam kicked off, Namgoong Jaehak's attention shifted elsewhere.

Relieved, he sent Ak Yeonho a telepathic message, [Where are the assassins?]

[Still trying to locate them,] came the reply as Ak Yeonho rubbed the back of his head.

Baek Suryong reached out to other colleagues scattered around, receiving similar updates. With the assassins on alert, they were harder to pinpoint than before.

[Hyung-nim, would assassins really make a move in a place this packed with martial artists?] Ak Yeonho asked.

*How naive.* Baek Suryong laughed darkly, [With all these eager young martial artists gathered for duels and the stands packed with spectators, what better place for an 'accident' to happen?]

[Ugh...]

"Don't let your guard down. They're probably getting desperate," Baek Suryong advised, patting the increasingly worried Ak Yeonho on the shoulder.

"......"

After Shadow contacted the Imperial Palace, the assassins probably knew they had to act quickly, meaning they'd probably try to take out Gongson Su today.

aggAnnoy14

"Alright, go back to standing watch," Baek Suryong instructed, keeping his senses sharp to every minor fluctuation in the crowd.

Meanwhile, duels unfolded across ten platforms.

"WOOOOOAH!" Cheers and applause erupted as one duel concluded.

"Candidate Namgoong Seok wins!" the referee announced, his voice faltering from shock—it was rare for a freshman to defeat a Student Council senior, especially a disciplinary committee member.

"Senior, thanks for going easy on me," Namgoong Seok said, bowing respectfully, though both the audience and his opponent recognized it as mere courtesy.

"...I lost," his opponent, known as one of the Twin Dragons of the Student Council, conceded, looking at his broken weapon in disbelief.

Baek Suryong watched Namgoong Seok closely. The boy wielded a sword, swift and sharp, whereas the Twin Dragon's weapon was a rope—a rare and complex choice.

*He's well-prepared. It's not every day you face such a weapon...*

Namgoong Seok had skillfully countered the rope throughout the duel, looking for an opportunity to sever it. Then, when he finally managed to do so, he closed in and lightly stabbed his opponent in the shoulder.

Baek Suryong turned to look at Namgoong Su in the distance. As usual, the man appeared indifferent to everything. 

aggAnnoy13

"He really did train them well," he grudgingly admitted.

Soon after, another student of Namgoong Su's, Jin Jin, also defeated a Student Council senior.

"Candidate Jin Jin wins!"

Unlike Namgoong Su, Jin Jin, who had struggled to win, jumped around excitedly, yelling, "Yesssss!"

Both students under Namgoong Su's tutelage had managed to upset their Student Council seniors.

From different parts of the stands, spectators murmured, "As expected of kids taught by the Star Instructor, Namgoong Su."

By then, however, Baek Suryong had lost interest in the two. He'd noticed a far more intriguing candidate.

"Rahhhhhh!" a large boy bellowed as he charged at his opponent. Despite his youthful face, he towered over most adults, his dark skin stretching over a robust, muscular frame.

"Come at me! Don't dodge, just come at me!"

Bruised and bloodied, the boy continued to fight, swinging his fists like a wild beast.

Unable to bear it any longer, the referee tried to halt the duel, "Candidate Ya Suhyeok! Stop! Enough!"

aggAnnoy14

"Ahhhhhh!" Ya Suhyeok continued, unheeding.

Baek Suryong's eyes widened as he watched the boy. *He's all raw power, and it seems he hasn't learned any inner arts... Huh. Color me impressed.*

"Damn, that build and temper... really reminds me of someone. Wait, this kid..."

"Candidate Gongson Su, please come forward!" a referee called out.

Baek Suryong's attention immediately shifted from Ya Suhyeok to Gongson Su. 

And so did many others.
