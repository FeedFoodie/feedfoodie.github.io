"Fufu, those guys were pretty amusing," Hell Axe remarked, setting a splint on his fractured arm. Even though he'd lost to some greenhorn juniors, he was in an excellent mood.

*Fun times like these are the reason why I keep working as a gatekeeper*, he mused. Besides, since he hadn't been beaten in martial arts but in arm-wrestling, his pride as a martial artist remained intact.

"Still, it's a bit of a shame. If only I were ten years younger... Anyway, I can't believe someone actually beat me, the one and only Hell Axe, in arm-wrestling! That kid's gonna go places, I tell you."

Wolf Fang Blade snorted, "Hmph. Looks like you've taken a liking to him."

Unlike his counterpart, Wolf Fang Blade was visibly displeased. Not only had the young bladesman who called himself the Crazy Asura survived ten exchanges, he had also meticulously observed his technique. Just the memory of those probing eyes irritated him, sending goosebumps up his arms.

*The next time I fight him, will I be able to dominate him like I did today?*

The mere thought was unsettling. 

"Those guys are suspicious. They seem to be the same types as us, but their inner arts feel too pure. That Crazy Asura's blade techniques were definitely ruthless, but... I just can't shake off the feeling that they have some other purpose," Wolf Fang Blade grumbled with a scowl.

"Eh, lots of folks come here with some agenda. As for their inner arts, it's not the first time someone from the orthodox has escaped here after committing some unforgivable crime," Hell Axe replied casually.

"Yeah, I guess that's true," Wolf Fang Blade nodded reluctantly. 

They were gatekeepers of the Valley of Evil, but they weren't obligated to kick out or kill anyone they found suspicious—unless the Murim Alliance invaded, of course. Short of something that serious, their aim was simply to enjoy toying with those who occasionally dropped by.

"By the way, Blue Eyed Freak," Hell Axe began, having finished with his splint. "About that pervert from earlier. Why'd you let him in without a test?"

"Not a pervert, the Handsome Playboy," Blue Eyed Freak corrected, staring at the entrance to the Valley of Evil where the Zhejiang Five Devils had gone with a peculiar grin.

"Same difference. Anyway, that pretty boy. Why'd you let him in without any test?"

"......" Blue Eyed Freak remained silent.

"Well? Spit it out. You know I can't stand not knowing when I'm curious. You're not the type to do that without a reason," Hell Axe pressed.

Under Hell Axe's persistent questioning, Blue Eyed Freak grinned and replied, "There was no need to test him."

"What do you mean, 'no need'?"

Recalling the look the Handsome Playboy had given him, Blue Eyed Freak said, "He's strong. While the others were undergoing the tests, he kept his eyes on us, ready to strike at any moment."

"Sure, but isn't it only natural to want to step in when one's sworn younger brothers look like they're in trouble?" Hell Axe asked.

"It wasn't just that. If things had gone wrong, he would have tried to kill us," Blue Eyed Freak explained.

"......" Hell Axe and Wolf Fang Blade fell silent.

The reason Blue Eyed Freak's eyes were a deep blue[^1] was because he'd mastered a special sight technique. Thanks to it, he could see things others couldn't, which is how he became the de facto leader of the Valley of Evil's gatekeepers. Of course, in terms of martial arts, he was also the strongest among the three.

"That's unsettling. Does he really have the ability to kill us?" Wolf Fang Blade asked, slightly worried.

"Well, we'd have to fight him to find out. Even my eyes can't see that much," Blue Eyed Freak admitted with a slight grin.

Radiating a ferocious killing intent, Hell Axe growled like a beast, "Damn it! If I'd known earlier, I'd have chopped off that Explosive Iron Fist's arm."

This was the Valley of Evil, a place where numerous murderous fiends who had survived unimaginable carnage lived in hiding.

"But we've already let them in, so it'd be silly to go pick a fight now... Plus, there's that rule about not messing with newcomers on their first day," Hell Axe reminded.

Despite being a collection of villains, even the Valley of Evil had its own set of rules. Otherwise, without any order or regulations, the place would have turned into a living hell ages ago.

"Well, if they last a few more days, we'll get another chance to see them," Blue Eyed Freak remarked.

The three gatekeepers gazed for a moment in the direction the Zhejiang Five Devils had gone. 

Then, as if something occurred to him, Wolf Fang Blade laughed, "That pervert. If he has a run-in with the Nine Yin Witch, there won't even be any bones left of him."

"Now that I think about it, the Nine Yin Witch hates guys who practice 'harvesting yin to nourish yang' the most, doesn't she?"

"That woman hates all men. She grits her teeth just seeing us."

"Heheh, that's true."

Along with the Bloody Ripper, the Nine Yin Witch was one of the most notorious villains in the Valley of Evil. Her mastery of ice techniques, which had secured her a position as one of the Ten Great Villains, could instantly freeze an area tens of meters in diameter. However, unlike the Bloody Ripper, who led the largest faction in the Valley, she lived alone in seclusion.

"Still, unless he's really unlucky, he won't run into her," Wolf Fang Blade mused.

"Then again, who knows? Maybe he can charm the Nine Yin Witch. You saw how good-looking he was, right? If he's half as good below..."

"Hehehe!"

"Hohoho!"

The two men burst into laughter. They shifted the conversation to dirty jokes, but even that lost its appeal soon enough.

"Man, I'm bored."

"That's life in the Valley of Evil."

Hell Axe sprawled out on a rock, yawning lazily. Wolf Fang Blade unsheathed his blade, saying he'd go feed it some beast's blood, and disappeared into the woods.

Only Blue Eyed Freak remained on watch. Licking his lips, he chuckled softly, "I've got a feeling something really interesting is about to happen."

With a look of intense thirst, he stared for a long time toward where the Zhejiang Five Devils had vanished, his deep blue eyes glittering coldly.

"So this is the Valley of Evil. I thought ghosts would pop up or something."

"Huh, it's not that different from any regular village."

The Zhejiang Five Devils—that is, Baek Suryong and his students—whispered among themselves as they surveyed the Valley of Evil. To be precise, it was the students who gawked around like country bumpkins, while Baek Suryong carefully observed and memorized the surroundings.

*Now I understand why the White-Haired Demon called this place a natural fortress,* Baek Suryong thought.

The Valley of Evil was shaped like a bottle gourd. After entering through its narrow neck, a wide basin spread out inside. The cliffs encircling the valley were so steep that even a peak-level master would struggle to ascend or descend without exceptional movement arts.

*And they've supposedly set up formations all around... Infiltrating this place secretly is impossible for me right now.* 

The students, intrigued, whispered among themselves as they looked around.

"Hey, there's a stream over there. And wait, are they farming?"

"Never thought villains from unorthodox sects would be into farming."

"Don't the folks here seem pretty normal? I thought they'd all look like Senior Wonkang..."

"What was that, punk?"

"Enough, you brats," Baek Suryong intervened to shut up his quarreling students. Turning to Wiji Cheon, who was hobbling along slowly, he asked, "Cheon, how are you holding up?"

"I-I'm okay..." Wiji Cheon replied weakly, even though his face was pale and Hyonwon Kang was supporting him with one arm.

"Just hang on a bit longer. We'll find the Demon Doctor soon. Sangwoong is also outside looking for a good physician, so don't worry," Baek Suryong reassured.

On the day the White-Haired Demon was killed, the group had a discussion, and Geo Sangwoong volunteered to remain outside. Utilizing the Golden Dragon Trading Company's branches, he would contact the Azure Dragon Academy and leverage his connections to summon a top-tier physician, in case they failed to secure the Demon Doctor's help in time.

"Can you describe your symptoms to me?" Baek Suryong asked.

"I feel really hot and dizzy, but it's bearable. I can still use my inner arts and swing my sword. Sometimes I feel a little chilly, but... No, I'm fine," Wiji Cheon said, forcing a smile.

*Since I don't know exactly what poison it is...* Baek Suryong thought, concern etched on his face. Despite Wiji Cheon's attempt at a smile, his pale face and blue lips proved that his condition was far from good.

Baek Suryong's knowledge of poisons rivaled that of most physicians, but the creation of an antidote was an entirely different matter, requiring the skills of a pharmacist rather than a healer.

Turning to the students, he said, "We need to find the Demon Doctor quickly. Let's ask around..."

Just then, someone approached them.

"Hello there. Are you new here?" a short and rotund middle-aged man wearing baggy black clothes asked. 

With a greasy smile, he added, "I'm called Black Boar, and I've been living in the Valley of Evil for five years now. When I first arrived here, I was scared out of my wits. This place has quite a reputation, doesn't it? Even I thought it was full of crazy cannibals who made murder their hobby, so I was constantly worried about whether the food was poisoned and couldn't sleep at night. Turns out, it's just another town where people live. Anyway, do you guys have a place to stay tonight?"

Baek Suryong clicked his tongue. It was clear the fatty was trying to con them. There was no way any of his students would fall for such an obvious scam... or so he thought.

"Haha! We're the Zhejiang Five Devils! We were just wondering where to stay and had some questions!" Hyonwon Kang exclaimed enthusiastically.

Black Boar immediately flattered, "Well, pardon my ignorant self for never having heard of your illustrious name, but you all look like you've mastered some serious martial arts."

"Hey, you know your stuff! About us..."

Seeing Hyonwon Kang blabbering away, completely taken in by Black Boar's flattery, Baek Suryong sighed quietly, "Good grief, what a gullible dumbass…"

SMACK!

"Ouch! Why'd you hit me?" Hyonwon Kang yelped, rubbing the back of his head, tears in his eyes. For some reason, Baek Suryong's smack hurt twice as much as usual.

"If you don't want to get hit again, move aside," Baek Suryong warned, shoving the boy aside. "You, I've got some questions for you," he said to Black Boar.

Black Boar gave him a quick once-over before grinning, "Hehe, you must be the leader of the Zhejiang Five Devils, right, handsome guy? Ask away. I'll help as much as I can…"

Without warning, Baek Suryong seized Black Boar by the collar. "If you mix any lies or omissions into your answers, I'll slice your tongue off bit by bit."

"U-Ugh! That would be bad! Very bad!" Black Boar squealed like a stuck pig. "In the Valley of Evil, we don't mess with newcomers on their first day. Newcomers shouldn't start fights on their first day either. That's the rule! We'll both be in big trouble if we break it, so I wasn't trying to swindle you, I swear!"

As Black Boar's shriek, infused with inner qi, echoed outward, passing villains began to gather one by one.

"Hey, didn't you hear what the Black Boar said?"

"Don't cause any trouble today, just behave."

"From tomorrow on, even if you want to stay quiet, you won't be able to."

The villains approached, their killing intent obvious, but none drew their weapons or tried to fight. They merely sneered, refraining from trying anything more than issuing a warning.

*Hmm, looks like the pig was telling the truth,* Baek Suryong reasoned, having deliberately threatened Black Boar to gauge the atmosphere of the Valley of Evil. 

He released the man's collar, pulled a silver coin from his robe and waved it side to side, saying, "Alright. Let's handle it this way then." 

Black Boar's eyes followed the coin's movement. As expected, he was a very greedy fellow.

"I'll pay you for information, so don't mess around and provide proper details. How about it?" Baek Suryong proposed.

Nothing came free in this world, especially in a place like the Valley of Evil. He was certain Black Boar would not refuse him.

As expected, a smile reappeared on Black Boar's lips. "Hehe, you seem very familiar with *negotiations*, eh? Well, if it's something I know, I'll answer sincerely. I'm not shameless enough to lie when I'm getting paid."

"Tell me where I can find the Demon Doctor," Baek Suryong demanded.

"......" Black Boar hesitated.

"Ah, so you don't know where he is," Baek Suryong said, turning to leave.

Caught off guard, Black Boar stammered, "I-I do know, but... you're not planning to go there right now, are you?"

"I am," Baek Suryong affirmed.

"Is it okay if I just give you the address..."

Baek Suryong pulled out a few more silvers. "No, lead us there. I don't trust you enough to just hand over my money. If you guide us to the Demon Doctor's place, this is yours."

"......" Black Boar's eyes flickered greedily.

"What? Don't want to earn some coin? Then I'll find someone else to guide us," Baek Suryong said, glancing around.

Instantly, a few other shady characters began to approach, their interest piqued.

"N-No! I'll guide you!" Black Boar exclaimed hastily.

Baek Suryong smiled and tossed him a silver coin. "Here's a down payment." 

"Follow me," Black Boar said, easily catching the coin. "Whether you regret this or not later has nothing to do with me though…" he mumbled to himself.

The Demon Doctor's abode was tucked away in a damp, secluded corner of the Valley of Evil.

"Ugh! It stinks..."

The students grimaced at the foul odor assaulting their noses, some even pinching their nostrils shut. The closer they got to the Demon Doctor's place, the more the air filled with a mix of smells—medicines, blood, animals, filth, and...

*…The stench of embalmed corpses.* Baek Suryong, who had witnessed several human experiments by the Blood Cult, still remembered this distinctive scent that triggered his worst nightmares. *There's no doubt, this Demon Doctor is a madman!*

Soon, with Black Boar leading the way, they arrived at the Demon Doctor's hut.

KNOCK, KNOCK.

Black Boar rapped on the door, cautiously calling out, "Elder Demon Doctor, are you there?"

"Who is it?" came a sharp, irritated voice from inside.

Black Boar bowed and replied, "It's Black Boar. I've brought some newcomers who wish to meet you."

"Newcomers? Tell them to come back later."

"U-Understood. Then I'll..."

"Later, my ass. Move aside," Baek Suryong interrupted, shoving Black Boar aside and kicking the door open.

BANG!

Black Boar shrieked, "You're mad!"

However, Baek Suryong ignored him, storming inside with his students.

The hut's interior was more spacious than expected. An old physician, in the midst of administering acupuncture to a patient, frowned at the intruders. "Looks like newcomers these days don't have manners," he said coldly.

"Youngsters these days are all like that," another old man lying down and getting acupuncture on his arm chuckled.

"H-Hey! If you behave so rudely, you'll be in serious trouble... Huh?!" Black Boar, who had rushed in after them, gasped upon seeing the old man lying down. His face went ashen, and he barely stopped himself from fainting. "E-Elder Bloody Ripper..." he whispered in terror.

The Bloody Ripper, one of the Ten Great Villains and the ruler of the Valley of Evil.

Unfortunately, it seemed that they had stumbled upon the Bloody Ripper being treated by the Demon Doctor.
