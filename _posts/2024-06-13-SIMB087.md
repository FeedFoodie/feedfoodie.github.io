Shadow landed lightly on a rooftop and approached Baek Suryong from behind. "Headmaster Mae Geuklyom has entered the Bloodletter branch," she reported.

"And the escape routes?" Baek Suryong asked impassively, without turning around to face her.

Surprised by his uncharacteristic indifference, Shadow replied succinctly, "I have blocked them. The perimeter is clear. We just need to deal with those inside the gambling den to make sure no information leaks out of Bloodletter."

"Well done," Baek Suryong acknowledged, scanning the ground below from his high vantage point. It was not his intention to give Shadow the cold shoulder, but he had to keep a constant eye on the crowd around Gongson Su and did not have the time to spare a glance at her.

"Three from the east. Two from the west. Two—no, three from the south."

His keen observation and analytical skills were on full display as he identified the assassins and communicated their positions to his ground team through telepathy.

[Yeonho, grab the old man at the fruit stand in the east.]

[Il-Oh, approach the courtesan in the red dress at the back.]

[Soyeong, see the young siblings about ten yards behind you? Engage them to buy some time.]

Following Baek Suryong's orders, his team obstructed the assassins' movements and made sure they couldn't reach Gongson Su, like pieces on a giant chessboard.

Suddenly, Baek Suryong narrowed his eyes and pointed in one direction, saying, "See that peddler over there? He looks quite skilled. Can you handle him? If not, I can..."

"I'll go," Shadow cut in, sounding slightly offended. Despite not being fully recovered, she leaped from the roof without hesitation, blended into the crowd, and dealt with the target efficiently and discreetly.

Watching from above, Baek Suryong smiled faintly. "Not bad. She definitely lives up to the title of Skyshadow's best assassin," he praised.

Of course, Ak Yeonho, Myeong Il-Oh, and Jaegal Soyeong were also doing an excellent job, enabling him to minimize his own movements and concentrate on orchestrating the action.

*Since Mae Geuklyom is dealing with Bloodletter, there's no need to worry about them.*

Bloodletter, more an unorthodox sect of freelance contract killers than a traditional assassins' guild, had branches scattered across several cities. While their locations were not widely known, Shadow, a former government agent, was privy to this information.

*I'll wipe them out in one move,* Baek Suryong thought as he played his strongest card, Mae Geuklyom. As the Headmaster of the Azure Dragon Academy, his grandfather was a typical orthodox sect martial artist who naturally despised such human butchers. His sword would show no mercy.

*The Black Forest will handle the Bloodletter assassins we missed.*

Indeed, the Black Forest had already mobilized. After hearing about Bloodletter's attack, the Third Captain's assassins began tracking down Bloodletter targets, striking in dark alleys, under shadowy walls, or while feigning friendly chats.

*It's nice that they save me the trouble of cleaning up after them,* Baek Suryong thought. The fascinating aspect of pitting assassin against assassin was that when the fight was over, one side or the other would simply close their eyes quietly, as if falling into a deep sleep. Accustomed to pain, they rarely screamed, resulting in a silent war. Moreover, the victor would even dispose of the body discreetly.

*Well, if a murder happens in broad daylight, law enforcement will intervene. I'm sure nobody wants things to escalate.*

"I'll exploit all of your weaknesses to the utmost," Baek Suryong whispered to himself, watching emotionlessly as his enemies dwindled their own ranks through mutual destruction. With Mae Geuklyom blocking Bloodletter from sending reinforcements, the Black Forest hunting down the rash and uncontrollable Bloodletter assassins, and Shadow along with temporary instructors from the Azure Dragon Academy targeting the Black Forest, Baek Suryong had everything under control.

"For now, that is..."

Everything was unfolding as planned, yet Baek Suryong remained vigilant.

*Deathshroud hasn't made a move yet.*

Deathshroud, the undisputed top assassin's guild in murim, was usually the prime suspect whenever a renowned master met an untimely death, but Baek Suryong's wariness toward Deathshroud stemmed not only from their reputation.

"The Blood Cult is gone, but Deathshroud remains..."

Even now, it seemed no one had uncovered the fact that Deathshroud was created by the Blood Cult. Furthermore, the leader of Deathshroud, known as the First Shroud, was traditionally one of the Elders of the Blood Cult.

aggAnnoy02

*The Murim Alliance never discovered the connection. Does that mean Deathshroud is now an independent force? Or... does the Blood Cult's legacy live on in Deathshroud?*

"I'll find out soon enough," Baek Suryong concluded, his eyes returning to the hustle around Gongson Su. "Shall we see who comes out on top in the end?"

This was bound to be a long, drawn-out battle, and Deathshroud would likely wait for the most critical moment to strike.

Baek Suryong was determined not to miss that moment.

"Hohohoho!" Gongson Su laughed heartily, his spirits unexpectedly high even though there was only an hour left before the sparring exam.

Hyonwon Kang, already burdened by the pressure, found his cheerfulness annoying. "Old man, why are you so cheerful? Aren't you worried about the exam?" he asked bluntly.

"I was a bit nervous this morning, but I'm feeling better now," Gongson Su replied, his eyes sweeping contentedly over the bustling streets of his hometown. "…Time really flies."

aggAnnoy08

It was only a month before that he had been confined to his room, unable to do much but look out the window at this very scenery. His frail health had limited him to short walks, and he had little interest in wandering around, for although Nanchang was his hometown, it had become unfamiliar to him.

His childhood friends were long gone, and most of the familiar streets and shops had vanished, leaving behind only faded memories. He had planned to spend his remaining days reflecting on those memories, until an unexpected stroke of luck turned everything around.

What started as an impulsive application for martial arts lessons to pass the time had transformed Gongson Su's life. His body, once riddled with ailments, was rejuvenated. Despite predictions from the Divine Physician that he wouldn't live much longer, he now found himself in remarkable health and had even received another invitation from the Emperor.

This turn of events made him both happy and somewhat melancholic.

"Hoho, let's go check out that place over there!" he suggested excitedly, pointing ahead.

"Do we really have to go there now?" Hyonwon Kang grumbled, sulking.

Gongson Su clicked his tongue at him. "Today is special. When else will we get a chance like this? Anyway, if you're going to keep complaining, feel free to head back first."

"Senior, are you sure you're feeling okay? If you're tired, you should rest," Wiji Cheon chimed in, concerned.

aggAnnoy05

"You're worse than him," Hyonwon Kang muttered, shooting a glare at the bewildered Wiji Cheon.

"Come on, let's go!" Gongson Su urged, leading them through the streets with enthusiasm. He bought sweets like a child, admired pretty girls like a horny teenage boy, and strode with the dignity of an elder. His face radiated joy, as if he was trying to recapture the years he had missed.

"Hoho! This is fun. I don't think I've ever enjoyed an outing this much in my life."

"You're getting senile in your old age," Hyonwon Kang complained, though he remained alert, his senses sharp to any dangers lurking around.

*People around us are disappearing one by one.*

A woman selling candied fruit was suddenly whisked away by an old friend, a courtesan smiling from afar was harassed by a man and retreated, and a child who had been crying on the street stopped abruptly and vanished into an alley with an eerily stern expression.

*What's happening around us?*

Hyonwon Kang felt a chill run down his spine. While Gongson Su and Wiji Cheon seemed oblivious to any danger, Hyonwon Kang was acutely aware and increasingly anxious.

"Hoho, let's go there next."

"Wow, that looks delicious!"

"Just kill me now..." Hyonwon Kang mumbled to himself as he trailed behind them, feeling like a nervous parent shepherding children.

By the time the exam was nearly due to resume, he was exhausted. 

aggAnnoy05

Gongson Su, noticing his fatigue, sighed regretfully, "We should head back to the Azure Dragon Academy. We can't be late for the afternoon exam."

"Finally… back to the Azure Dragon Academy!"

"Senior, why do you look so tired?" Wiji Cheon asked.

"I'd rather die than keep this up..." Hyonwon Kang groaned.

The trio started walking toward the Azure Dragon Academy. Gongson Su lingered a moment longer, glancing around, aware that this might be his last day in Nanchang.

Hyonwon Kang prodded him impatiently, "Old man, are you going to the exam or not?"

"Hoho, yes, yes, I'm going," Gongson Su replied, reluctantly moving forward.

Soon, the grand sign of the Azure Dragon Academy came into view. As the afternoon sparring session was open to the public, the school grounds were abuzz with activity. 

"…Just so you know, even if I pass the entrance exam, I won't be attending the academy," Gongson Su casually mentioned all of a sudden.

"What?"

"Why not?"

Surprised, the two boys stared at him in disbelief.

aggAnnoy07

Gongson Su smiled sadly. "As soon as the exam is over, I'll be returning to the Imperial Palace."

"This is so sudden!"

"Why?"

"I sent word that my health had improved, and I was summoned back. It's an honor, but I feel a bit wistful," he admitted. "I've had a wonderful time, even if only for a little while."

""......"" Hyonwon Kang and Wiji Cheon had seen Gongson Su strive tirelessly for the past month, but it was only now that they discovered he wouldn't be staying with them. Unable to protest, they fell silent.

"Ahem, I've made things awkward, haven't I? Let's go inside," Gongson Su said, breaking the awkward silence.

"…Old man, I'll protect you," Hyonwon Kang suddenly blurted, overtaking the old man and taking the lead.

"Hm? Protect me from what?"

"Never mind. Just focus on your exam," the boy said, then raised his voice, "Clear the way! A third year senior of the Azure Dragon Academy is coming through! Move, or do you want to die?"

The crowd quickly parted, intimidated by his fierce tone. 

Gongson Su laughed heartily, "Hahaha! I feel like I have an army with me! But, won't you get in trouble with Mr. Baek later?"

"I'll take care of that when the time comes. Get ready for the exam," Hyonwon Kang replied, brushing off the frightening thought.

However, just as they were about to go through the academy gates, a stranger stepped into their path. 

"I've been waiting for you," he said.
