A windstorm swept across the Northern Army Fortress, accompanied by a thunderous boom.

"Kuheuk!" the Wardens coughed as they breathed in the dust cloud that had risen as a result of the clash. However, the pain that they had been anticipating never arrived.

They opened their eyes slowly, only to see a black-clothed man standing in front of them and protecting them.

For an instant, the man's back seemed like an impregnable wall.

"Y-Young Master Dam!"

The Wardens' eyes, which had been filled with despair, once again shone with the light of hope. They had instantly recognized Dam Soo-Cheon from behind. He was the only person in the fortress who exhibited such might and authority, like a wall that would never fall.

However, in truth, Dam Soo-Cheon was quite shaken. Although he had successfully defended against Tae Mu-Kang's attack, the amount of damage he had taken wasn't something he could ignore. From the way Tae Mu-Kang's flux had hit him like a ton of bricks, he could tell that this opponent was stronger than anyone he had fought before.

*Who is this guy? To think that someone like this existed.*

He was Dam Soo-Cheon, the man who had completed the Hundred Duels Trial. Even so, no one had managed to surprise him more than Tae Mu-Kang.

His skin was pricking from Tae Mu-Kang's flux, and his nerves were screaming in pain. This was his body telling him that he was in extreme danger.

Tae Mu-Kang looked at Dam Soo-Cheon curiously, as if the young man was an interesting toy. He asked, "Hey, what's your name?"

"My name is Dam Soo-Cheon. Who are you, Senior,[^1] and why are you making a ruckus in someone else's home?"

"Hahaha! So you were the brat with the guts to call himself the 'Lone Star of the Azure Sky'!"

Dam Soo-Cheon's eyebrow twitched. He said, "Since you know who I am, you should be aware of the consequences of doing such a thing in front of me, right?"

"There is no need for an arrogant young master like you to be concerned about me. I don't know about the people of the Central Plains, but I'm not afraid of you."

"The people of the Central Plains? I suppose I can take that phrase to mean that you are not a martial artist from the Central Plains."

Tae Mu-Kang did not reply. Instead, he smiled mysteriously.

Dam Soo-Cheon's eyes narrowed.

*How can a man this strong be totally unknown to the gangho? The only reason for that is that he has never done anything in the Central Plains. If so, is there anywhere besides the Central Plains where a monster like this can be created?*

aggAnnoy03

*Yes, there is.*

"You're from the Silent Night, aren't you?"

"I wonder…"

"!!!" Dam Soo-Cheon needed no further confirmation for his suspicions than Tae Mu-Kang's ambiguous reply.

*He's really from the Silent Night!? The Silent Night that vanished for thirty whole years? Weren't they disbanded or something?*

*Is an era of war going to start again?*

Dam Soo-Cheon shivered, not because he was afraid, but because he was excited. If this man truly was from the Silent Night, then the chaotic era he had always dreamed of would begin anew.

Only after the old world order had been destroyed could a brand new one be created. To the current establishment, the appearance of the Silent Night was a disaster. However, to youngsters like Dam Soo-Cheon, it was an opportunity.

*The heavens are indeed favoring me.*

aggAnnoy02

Dam Soo-Cheon clenched his fist.

Seeing Dam Soo-Cheon's reaction to his answer, Tae Mu-Kang sniggered. A glance was enough to tell him how ambitious Dam Soo-Cheon was, and he indeed had the strength to back up that ambition.

Tae Mu-Kang reminded, "Oi, before your imagination gets out of hand, remember that you have to survive today or else everything is meaningless."

…He did not have any intention of letting Dam Soo-Cheon live, though. Although Dam Soo-Cheon was still young, he already possessed a strong spirit and an intimidating aura. As time passed, Tae Mu-Kang couldn't even begin to imagine just how strong Dam Soo-Cheon would become. This potential threat had to be eliminated before it had a chance to grow up.

Tae Mu-Kang emanated a killing aura that seemed to corrode his surroundings.

Dam Soo-Cheon readied himself for battle, then said, "Stand back, Wardens."

"Understood!" The Wardens immediately supported each other and limped out of the battleground as quickly as they could.

Tae Mu-Kang's body seemed to grow even larger, but that was only an illusion. Still, the fact that Dam Soo-Cheon saw such an illusion told him that Tae Mu-Kang's qi was far stronger than his. Even so, he did not lose heart. Rather, his fighting spirit was getting fired up just thinking about how he was going to challenge the impossible.

Tae Mu-Kang was the first real wall he had to overcome. If he chose to avoid facing this wall because of fear, there would be no future for him.

*I will topple this wall with my very own hands.*

WHOOSH!

As Dam Soo-Cheon summoned all of his qi, little whirlwinds started appearing around him, and the air began to tremble. His qi was resonating with his surroundings.

"Brat!" yelled Tae Mu-Kang, leaping towards Dam Soo-Cheon.

ROAR!

The Whirlwind Flux of the Chaos Demon tore through the air with Tae Mu-Kang at its center, but Dam Soo-Cheon charged headfirst into the storm.

He raised a glowing fist.

BOOM!

"Guh!" Shim Won Ui and Seomoon Hye-Ryung groaned. A battle of unimaginable proportions was taking place right in front of them. Tae Mu-Kang's chaotic flux displayed might that shocked the world. Dam Soo-Cheon's fists flashed with blinding light every time he clashed with Tae Mu-Kang.

aggAnnoy14

The Lustrous Jade Palace was quickly demolished by the battle, sending dust flying everywhere. It was chaos.

"Is the Silent Night finally coming out of hiding?" said Shim Won-Yi. He had not factored the appearance of the Silent Night into his plans. Like everyone else in the Central Plains, he had believed that the Silent Night had been completely eradicated. *No, I convinced myself that it was gone, because I wanted it to be so.*

"If that man really is a warrior from the Silent Night, and if the Silent Night has raised a new generation of martial artists, I'll have to make some big changes to my plans."

Even though he was standing far from the battlefield, the two shockingly powerful presences still made his heart race.

Jin Mu-Won and Eun Han-Seol stood behind Shim Won-Yi. As Eun Han-Seol looked at Tae Mu-Kang, she couldn't help but shiver in fear.

*To think that monster chased me all the way here!*

Eun Han-Seol understood Tae Mu-Kang better than anyone else currently inside the Northern Army Fortress. The giant was the very reason she had to escape and hide in the fortress to begin with.

The Chaos Demon, Tae Mu-Kang, was the most perfect hunter created by her enemies.

aggAnnoy16

Suddenly, her gaze met Tae Mu-Kang's. Even while fighting with Dam Soo-Cheon, Tae Mu-Kang hadn't let Eun Han-Seol out of his sight.

Goosebumps popped up all over her skin.

Suddenly, someone placed a warm hand on her shoulder. She turned around and saw that it was Jin Mu-Won.

Jin Mu-Won smiled, saying, "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Eun Han-Seol shook her head and grabbed Jin Mu-Won's hand.

"You should run away."

"Why?"

"That man is very scary. Dam Soo-Cheon is not a match for him."

"He's that strong?"

"If my master doesn't come here in time, no one here will be able to defeat him. That's why, Mu-Won, you have to run away!"

"What about you?"

"I'm his target. No matter where I go, he will come after me."

aggAnnoy07

*That's why, if you continue being together with me, you will be in danger too.*

Eun Han-Seol looked Jin Mu-Won in the eye and said, "Mu-Won, you don't have to place yourself in danger because of me."

"I'm sorry, but I won't run away."

"……"

"This is my home. The Northern Army Fortress might be a ruin, but it's the place where I was born and raised. I won't run away just because a wild beast is rampaging around in my backyard."

aggAnnoy05

"But…"

"No buts. At the end of the day, my most important reason for not leaving is because… I will never leave you behind and run away by myself."

"Mu…Won." Eun Han-Seol's eyes trembled. Through a blurry lens made up of tears, she looked at the smiling man in front of her.

Suddenly, Jin Mu-Won raised his head and surveyed their surroundings. He mumbled, "Well, it's too late to run anyway."

Warriors dressed in bloodstained gray clothes appeared on the fortress walls. They were Tae Mu-Kang's Gray Wolves of Chaos, and they were returning to their master after finishing a hunt.

[^1]: Senior: The term Dam Soo-Cheon uses is "sunbae", which in modern times is used to respectfully address someone your senior (e.g. in school or work). However, in LNB, the historical meaning of "sunbae" is used, and it refers more to "respected old man/woman", or "respected master" than just someone a year or two older.
