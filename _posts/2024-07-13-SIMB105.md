"I'm warning you, if your petty squabbles tarnish the academy's honor again, I won't forgive either of you. Do you understand?" Noh Goonsang scolded, glaring at the two instructors seated before him and radiating a commanding presence so intense that it stifled the air itself.

"......"

The recent scandal, where an Azure Dragon Academy instructor was almost arrested, had only been quelled by Noh Goonsang's timely intervention. After a long mediation, he finally persuaded the courtesan, Nan Hyang, not to press charges.

In truth, it was Baek Suryeong who had secretly instructed Cheong Cheon and Nan Hyang to de-escalate the matter.

[Orabeoni~ I've repaid your favor. Come have a drink with me later. My treat.]

After playing her part to perfection, Nan Hyang had scribbled this message on a note and passed it to Baek Suryeong as she left with a furtive wink.

Pung Jinho protested, "Principal, this is really unfair! This man spread false rumors in collusion with that courtesan to slander me..."

Unleashing an aura so terrifying it seemed to crush the very breath from Pung Jinho, Noh Goonsang chastised, "Mr. Pung, do you really think I'm that clueless?"

"Principal, please..." Pung Jinho desperately pleaded, trembling at the revelation.

"Enough! I've confirmed that you two were at the brothel that day, but I don't care about the specifics. What's important is that you've brought disgrace to the Azure Dragon Academy!"

Pung Jinho's face drained of color.

On the other hand, Baek Suryeong, ever the picture of calm, bowed his head and murmured, "I'm sorry."

*How dare he still be so smug? He deserves to be torn apart!* Pung Jinho seethed silently. Despite both being embroiled in the scandal, he suffered far more. His twenty years of teaching and his painstakingly built reputation were at stake, whereas Baek Suryeong was merely a newcomer with nothing to lose.

Noh Goonsang's frown deepened as he continued, "I've reviewed your lecture plans. The content is nearly identical, and the timing overlaps. What exactly is your goal? To outshine each other or to genuinely educate our students?"

"......" Both instructors could do nothing but hang their heads, unable to meet Noh Goonsang's piercing gaze.

Clicking his tongue, Noh Goonsang laid out his decision, "Here's what we'll do. I'll conduct a thorough review of your lectures over the next two weeks. Whoever scores lower will have their class canceled."

"What?"

"Principal?"

Shock registered on the faces of the two instructors, but Noh Goonsang remained unyielding, "The students from the canceled class will join the remaining one. Any objections?"

Both instructors quickly weighed the implications. Ultimately, confident in their abilities, they responded almost in unison.

"None."

"Understood."

Noh Goonsang dismissed them with a cold wave, "Good, remember my words. You can leave now."

The two quickly stood and left the principal's office.

As soon as they were outside, a chilling killing intent emanated from Pung Jinho as he turned to Baek Suryeong. "Don't think this is over," he snarled.

Dropping all pretenses of civility, Baek Suryeong replied with a sly grin, "Of course not. The fun is just beginning."

Since they were now officially adversaries, they could finally be honest with each other. The two men exchanged cold smiles.

"You're getting overconfident after a single hollow victory. Do you think spreading a few rumors is all it takes to ruin me?"

"Wow, such killing intent. Are you planning to hire an assassin?"

"Why bother killing you? Making you regret your existence is much more appealing."

"To think we were on the same page after all. I wasn't going to let you off easily either."

"You little..."

Their heated exchange was cut short by a new arrival.

"Gentlemen, are you finished with the principal?"

At the end of the hallway stood the PTA Chairwoman, Seo Ri'ae, waiting for them.

Pung Jinho greeted her with a bright smile, "Madam Seo, were you waiting for me? I'll explain the situation in detail..."

However, Seo Ri'ae was not interested in Pung Jinho. "Mr. Pung, I'm sorry, but I'd like to speak with Mr. Baek Suryeong alone. Could you give us some privacy?" she said plainly.

"...What?" Pung Jinho's face fell, and he quickly tried to reason with her, "Madam Seo, please hear me out first..."

"I don't have time to listen to your excuses," Seo Ri'ae interrupted, cutting him off with a harsher tone than usual. Instead, she turned to Baek Suryeong with a gentle smile and politely asked, "Mr. Baek Suryeong, may I have a word with you?"

"Of course," Baek Suryeong replied warmly, his formal tone belying his satisfaction.

*This wretched woman!* Anger flared in Pung Jinho. Just an hour earlier, Seo Ri'ae had been adamant about sacking Baek Suryeong, yet now her demeanor had shifted completely. *Is it because Baek Suryeong and the courtesan revealed what happened at the brothel? No, she's not that naive.*

They knew each other too well. This sudden shift was undoubtedly a calculated political move.

*Does she think Baek Suryeong might outdo me?*

If so, it made sense. Seo Ri'ae was likely evaluating Baek Suryeong's potential and at the same time sending a signal to Pung Jinho that his position was now precarious.

*She's underestimating me.*

Despite his fury, Pung Jinho managed to regain his composure. Losing his temper or pleading with Seo Ri'ae would be the worst possible move. He needed to withdraw quietly and prepare his counterattack.

"Madam Seo, I'll see you next time," he said, bowing formally before leaving.

Seo Ri'ae didn't even glance his way, her attention fixed on Baek Suryeong. "I heard you tutored the top incoming student this year."

Wiji Cheon was now a well-known name among the members of the PTA.

> "The top student, Wiji Cheon, was tutored in martial arts by the new instructor, Baek Suryeong."
>
> "Not only that, but Baek Suryeong also taught a sixty-six-year-old man so well he passed the entrance exam."

The parents were already buzzing about it. Yet, despite numerous requests for tutoring, Baek Suryeong had declined, stating his dedication to academy classes.

"Well, that's because Cheon is exceptionally talented. I didn't do much."

"You're too modest." Seo Ri'ae chuckled behind her fan, though her eyes remained emotionless. "And excessive modesty can come off as arrogance. Are you going to attribute the oldest student in history to talent too? I prefer honesty."

"If you insist." Baek Suryeong's polite smile vanished, replaced with a confident grin teetering on the edge of arrogance. "Fine, I'll stop pretending. I am indeed quite skilled. Far beyond someone like Pung Jinho."

Seo Ri'ae appreciated his forthrightness. "Mr. Pung has twenty years of connections and decent teaching skills. What do you have, Mr. Baek?" she probed.

This was a critical moment. Baek Suryeong's response would shape how the PTA saw him. Her sharp gaze seemed to challenge him, as if to say, 'Choose your words wisely.'

To her surprise, Baek Suryeong didn't hesitate. 

He grinned playfully, boasting, "I'm an exceptional martial artist, have a brilliant mind, outstanding eloquence, noble character, and a handsome face that's conducive to teaching... Shall I continue?"

Seo Ri'ae laughed with a hint of sarcasm, "I admire your confidence and spirit, though it might just be bravado..."

Baek Suryeong beamed. "Words are meaningless. Just watch. I'll transform the Azure Dragon Academy."

"Hmm..." Seo Ri'ae pondered his bold promise to win the Heavenly Martial Festival for the academy. *I think it's unlikely, but... I can't deny the recent changes within the academy since his arrival.*

After a pause, she spoke again, "My son, Hyeon, is in the fourth grade, so he probably won't be taking your classes."

"I've heard he's an exceptional student," Baek Suryeong replied smoothly, having memorized the names of all the prominent students in the Azure Dragon Academy. Seo Ri'ae's son, Bang Baekhyeon, was not only last year's student council president but had also upheld the academy's honor at the previous Heavenly Martial Festival.

Seo Ri'ae beamed proudly at the mention of her son. "He's destined to become the Murim Alliance Chairman. Take good care of him."

"That's an admirable goal." Baek Suryeong nodded, impressed yet somewhat taken aback.

*The Murim Alliance Chairman?*

Traditionally, the top leader of the unorthodox sects was the Blood Demon, and the orthodox sects' equivalent was the Murim Alliance Chairman. However, unlike the unorthodox sects which believed in the law of the jungle, becoming the Chairman of the Murim Alliance wasn't determined by martial prowess alone, but also required a clean reputation, popularity, and political acumen.

In summary, becoming the leader of the orthodox was a much more difficult task than dominating the unorthodox.

*This lady seriously wants her son to become the Murim Alliance Chairman?*

Although he had not met Bang Baekhyeon and thus could not judge the boy's ambition, Seo Ri'ae's ambition at least burned fiercely like molten lava, in stark contrast to her icy demeanor.

Seo Ri'ae smiled dreamily. "The stronger the Azure Dragon Academy graduates in the Murim Alliance are, the better my Hyeon's chances will be, don't you think?"

Her vision stretched decades into the future, envisioning all of the academy's graduates as her son's future subordinates.

*Well, no need to dampen her dreams.* Baek Suryeong matched her smile with one of his own. "Certainly, with my dedicated guidance, the academy will soon produce many remarkable martial artists."

"Thank you. Teaching your students well is the best way to support my son," Seo Ri'ae giggled, seemingly pleased with his response. *Baek Suryeong is young, ambitious, skilled, and capable of standing up to Pung Jinho. He's no ordinary person.*

However, she wasn't yet ready to fully side with Baek Suryeong at the expense of alienating Pung Jinho.

"Regardless, the PTA won't involve itself in personal conflicts between you and Mr. Pung. I hope everything resolves amicably," she stated, declaring her neutrality.

Baek Suryeong's smile flickered briefly.

*…No, this is enough. The PTA, Pung Jinho's strongest connection, has now backed out. Additionally, I've developed a personal relationship with Seo Ri'ae.*

Grasping the whole picture, he smiled again, saying, "Thank you for your consideration."

"We'll see each other again." Seo Ri'ae waved him goodbye and walked away with graceful steps, leaving a chill in the air.

Baek Suryeong waited until she was completely out of sight before sighing softly, "Wow. She's definitely not your average woman."

Her unnaturally obsessed eyes when she spoke about her son were unforgettable, and most importantly, they reminded him of something he had seen just recently.

*Her eyes are the eyes of someone consumed by their inner demons.*

Of course, he couldn't be sure. It was nearly impossible to determine if a martial artist was plagued by inner demons just by their eyes. Moreover, her actions and speech showed no peculiarities other than an excessive obsession with her son.

"…Well, it's not my concern," Baek Suryeong concluded, then turned away, his mind filled with more pressing tasks.

*First, Pung Jinho won't dare act rashly for now.*

Thanks to the courtesan Nan Hyang's revelations, all the contempt once directed at Baek Suryeong was now aimed at Pung Jinho. Coupled with Noh Goonsang's stern warning, Pung Jinho would have to lie low for a while.

This meant Baek Suryeong could move more freely.

"First, I need to fill my minimum class requirement."

Five students. However, he wasn't just looking to fill numbers, he intended to recruit students with the potential he sought.

Baek Suryeong grinned, whispering to himself, "I'm looking forward to this."

The next morning, Baek Suryeong received a list from Tang Soso containing the names and necessary information of three individuals.

**Translator's Note:** Releases will probably slow next week as I will be away on a business trip. Hopefully last week's mass release can make up for it. Well, I might work on some chapters in the hotel room if I get bored, so fingers crossed…
