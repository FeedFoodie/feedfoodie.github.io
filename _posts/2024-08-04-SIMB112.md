Although the White Dragon Manor was still shrouded in the darkness before dawn, three students in black martial arts uniforms stood in a neat line on the training grounds like new recruits in the military.

"Welcome, students."

"......"

Usually, at this ungodly hour, a certain someone's screams reverberated through the grounds, but today, an uneasy silence filled the air.

Sporting a bright red headband, Baek Suryong grinned broadly and flashed his pearly whites at the students. "Starting today, you will gather here every morning at this time for training."

The trio stood in stunned silence, still mentally processing the sudden change in their lives.

"Why am I here...?" Yeo Min muttered, her eyes still glazed over from the mysterious and abrupt cancellation of her contract with the Golden Dragon Inn.

Geo Sangwoong, who had just been kicked out of the house by his father and shipped to the White Dragon Manor, squirmed uncomfortably in his tight-fitting martial arts uniform, grumbling, "Damn it, stupid Father..."

"Huh? What? Why?" Ya Suhyeok echoed, confusion written all over his face. Having spent the night with Geo Sangwoong, he had conveniently also been loaded into the same carriage and dropped off at the mansion like an afterthought.

CLAP!

Baek Suryong clapped his hands sharply, snapping the students out of their own little worlds.

"All right, kids, listen up. You'll be staying at the White Dragon Manor this semester. I've already informed the Headmaster, so don't even think about lodging a complaint with him."

When Baek Suryong had first brought up the idea of boarding school for the Remedial Class delinquents, Mae Geuklyom had been hesitant.

> "Those kids? Handling them one by one is tough enough, yet you're making them live together...?"
>
> "They're all very individualistic. Rather than the strictly managed dorms, I think a freer environment would be more conducive to their education."
>
> Mae Geuklyom stared at Baek Suryong for a while, then nodded slowly. "I see. Fine, if you're confident, give it a try."

*Confident? Of course I'm confident. Compared to the lunatics from the Blood Cult, these rebellious teens are a cakewalk. Also, since the White Dragon Manor is my property, I can get away with punishing them any way I want.*

The 'freer environment' he'd mentioned to Mae Geuklyom referred to his freedom, not that of the students. Thankfully, Mae Geuklyom hadn't caught on to the ambiguity in his words.

Imagining the fun times ahead, Baek Suryong smiled cheerfully. "Let's do our best together, students."

Seeing his wicked grin, the three students' winced.

*I-I'm fucked...*

*Was quitting dancing and coming here really the right decision?*

*I've never even lived in a dorm. Now I have to stay in this shabby place?*

As if he could read their thoughts, Baek Suryong chuckled, "Don't be too nervous. Since you guys are new, we won't be doing intense morning training today. Let's get to know each other first."

"......"

"Unfortunately, I can't hang out with you all day. I am, after all, a man with a respectable job."

Once the semester began, Baek Suryong could only train the Remedial Class students at dawn and after work.

*Thank goodness...*

*Phew...*

However, when there was a will, there was a way. Fortunately, two students at the White Dragon Manor had been trained by Baek Suryong before the semester started.

"Let me introduce someone who will help with your training for a while. Come forward, my experienced assistant."

"Fufufu..." Wearing the same red headband as Baek Suryong, Hyonwon Kang stepped forward, laughing evilly. Licking his lips, he said, "Welcome, new recruits. This place is hell beyond your imagination. Whether you came here willingly or not, leaving is no longer an option. And if you dare to defy me..."

BONK!

Baek Suryong smacked Hyonwon Kang's head with the Black Dragon Pointer and shot him a look of utter disdain. "That's enough. You've only been in a position of authority for a few seconds, and already you're corrupted by power? Tsk tsk."

"Ugh... B-But newcomers need to be disciplined from the start," Hyonwon Kang protested, clutching his head in pain.

"And you think you're the one to do that?"

"Because I'm a senior here..."

"So you're a senior only when it's convenient, and a delinquent at all other times?"

Seeing the two of them bickering like neighborhood thugs, Wiji Cheon, who had been quietly watching, couldn't help but giggle, "Pfft!

Everyone's attention immediately turned to him.

Hunching his shoulders to make his already small self appear even smaller, Wiji Cheon stuttered meekly, "P-Pleased to m-meet you..."

Despite his overwhelming presence whenever he wielded his sword, Wiji Cheon was usually very shy.

Ya Suhyeok glared at Wiji Cheon. "Hey, Wiji Cheon."

"Y-Yes?"

Although they were both freshmen, Ya Suhyeok's size made them look like an adult and a child.

Burning with competitive spirit, Ya Suhyeok growled, "Don't get cocky because you're at the top of the class. I'll catch up soon."

"S-Sorry..."

Hyonwon Kang laughed. "What's this punk saying? You think you can catch up to Wiji Cheon? You can't even beat me."

"Stay out of this, Senior."

"And what if I don't? Want to have another go at me?"

"Do you think I won't?"

THWACK! SMACK!

Just as Hyonwon Kang and Ya Suhyeok were about to collide, the Black Dragon Pointer struck their heads.

"Argh!"

"Ouch!"

This time, the blow was even more powerful, and both of them ended up lying face down on the ground.

"If you want to fight, ask my permission first," Baek Suryong scolded, although he didn't see fierce rivalry between students as a problem.

*Having rivals and goals is a good thing.*

Wiji Cheon, Hyonwon Kang, and Ya Suhyeok were all exceptionally talented and dedicated. Currently, Wiji Cheon was the strongest of the three, followed by Hyonwon Kang, and then Ya Suhyeok, but by the time the Heavenly Martial Festival arrived, the order might change.

*At their age, they grow at unpredictable rates.*

After assessing the three, Baek Suryong turned to Yeo Min, who was shaking her head at the two collapsed students.

"I have to live with these idiots," she complained.

Without heavy makeup, Yeo Min's face looked surprisingly youthful, her long hair casually tied back in a ponytail.

*As long as I dangle a huge money carrot in front of her, this girl doesn't need any extra motivation*, Baek Suryong concluded, confident that she would train hard.

*The real problem is that guy...* Baek Suryong's eyes settled on Geo Sangwoong.

"Yaaawn..." Geo Sangwoong yawned loudly, clearly emphasizing that he was here against his will.

Of course, Baek Suryong also had plans for Geo Sangwoong. First, he wanted to push the young man to his limits.

In a lousy attempt to soothe the nervous students, Baek Suryong smiled kindly and said, "Alright, enough talk. Let's start morning training. Don't worry too much. Since today's only the first day, we'll just do a light warm-up."

"Phew..."

"Thank goodness..."

"Yaaawn..."

For the moment, the new recruits looked relieved, but it didn't take them long to realize that this was a blatant lie.

{sep}

"Huff... Huff..."

"Water, please..."

"Just kill me..."

"Fucking liar..."

"Eh? Who am I? Where am I...?"

The students lay sprawled on the ground, moaning. Their muscles were trembling so hard they couldn't stand, and the sky was spinning above them. Their black martial arts uniforms, drenched in sweat and caked with dirt, felt like they weighed a ton.

"Such wimps," Baek Suryong grumbled as he walked among the fallen students, poking their tense muscles with the Black Dragon Pointer.

"Aaah!"

"Ouch!"

At first, they cried out in pain, but soon, their faces relaxed and they lay still. After a while, Hyonwon Kang and Wiji Cheon, who were used to Baek Suryong's morning training, were the first to get up.

"I'm going to wash up and head off to work. Take care of the others and show them around today," Baek Suryong said to them. Then, with a click, he retracted the Black Dragon Pointer and walked away.

Yeo Min, her face pale, asked in a low voice, "Is he... a monster?"

Baek Suryong had trained together with them for an hour, yet he looked as energetic as if he hadn't exerted himself at all.

Wiji Cheon replied wearily, "He wasn't always like this... but at some point, he stopped getting out of breath after morning training."

"It feels like he's the one who's getting stronger... but someday, I'll definitely get one over him..." Hyonwon Kang muttered, but fell silent when Baek Suryong halted and looked back at him as if he had a sixth sense for insults.

Nevertheless, to the newcomers who couldn't even move, Hyonwon Kang and Wiji Cheon, who were already back on their feet and stretching, looked like monsters as well.

"Let's go get breakfast," Hyonwon Kang said, moving to help them all up, but a big hand pushed his hand aside.

It was Geo Sangwoong.

"You guys go ahead."

"Senior, aren't you hungry?" Hyonwon Kang said casually, despite being a year younger than Geo Sangwoong.

Luckily, Geo Sangwoong didn't mind the rudeness. Smiling, he stood up, dusting off the dirt. "I'll eat elsewhere. You guys can't afford my meals."

"Where are you going?"

"I'll be back by dinner."

"Why not eat together?"

Ignoring the voices calling out to him, Geo Sangwoong left the White Dragon Manor. 

Ya Suhyeok hesitated for a moment, then hurried after Geo Sangwoong, yelling, "Fuck... Wait for me! I'm going with you!"

"Hey, freshman! Where are you going?!" Hyonwon Kang shouted, but the two large young men ignored him and disappeared into the distance.

He clicked his tongue in annoyance. "Hmphâ€¦ As expected, delinquents don't follow orders, do they?"

{sep}

"You didn't have to come with me."

"Fuck. Do you think I'm following you for fun?"

Seeing the grumpy Ya Suhyeok, Geo Sangwoong chuckled. "Is it because of the bet?"

"......"

Yesterday, they had bet on who could eat the most, with the loser serving the winner for three days. Although Geo Sangwoong won and said it wasn't necessary, Ya Suhyeok insisted on being his servant.

"Then carry this, servant."

"Damn it..."

Geo Sangwoong handed his thick wallet to Ya Suhyeok who grimaced but took it.

"Fuck. I'll beat you up when this is over."

"With those skills?"

"...After I improve."

Geo Sangwoong burst out laughing. Ya Suhyeok reminded him of his younger self. Confident and full of energy, believing that the world was his oyster. Back when he was passionate about learning martial arts and thought he could do anything. Back before... the Heavenly Martial Festival.

> "With those skills?"

Even after two years, the face of that person who had mocked him still haunted him.

Geo Sangwoong smiled bitterly. "Let's just eat."
