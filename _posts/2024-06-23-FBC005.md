The bitter cold gnawed sharply at the dawn air on the mountain behind the Jeong Family Estate.

*If the wind streaming through the valley had a color, it would surely be ash-gray,* Jeong Yeonsin mused. 

After spending the night burying the dead, he, the chamberlain, a handful of surviving servants, Jeong Jungsan, and the Zhongnan Sect's martial artists were all unrecognizable through the dirt staining their clothes. Off to the side, his niece Jeong Hye-ah sat huddled in a ball after crying herself to sleep.

Jeong Yeonsin looked down at the soil beneath him. The earth was bare and lifeless now, but within a year, new sprouts would bloom, erasing all evidence of the grim fate that had befallen those who once ruled the region.

"It's over," he declared, shattering the silence.

"So it seems. Alas, this once insignificant, nameless mountain has now become a sorrowful graveyard," the chamberlain agreed, nodding solemnly.

Jeong Yeonsin shook his head. "No, I meant that it's over for the Jeong Family."

"……" Silence fell as the chamberlain sank into deep contemplation.

Turning away, Jeong Yeonsin approached the Zhongnan Sect martial artists, whose eyes still brimmed with vitality despite their fatigue and injuries. "Master Shearing Cliff Sword, Master Silencing Fist, thank you once again for your assistance," he said, bowing deeply.

Despite the difference in age and experience, the Shearing Cliff Sword responded with respect, "No need to thank us, Master Jeong. It's only right that we help our junior brother's family."

"Moreover… This is our fault. We had prior information about the attack but failed to prevent it. It's our responsibility," the Silencing Fist added, his voice tinged with shame.

Just then, Jeong Jungsan joined them, cradling Hye-ah in his arms. The ordeal had clearly taken its toll on him; his now serious demeanor was a far cry from his usual frivolity.

"How can I apologize for years of accumulated bullying and discrimination in just a single phrase?" he lamented, his face strained. "Still, I'm sorry. When we meet again, I hope to be a decent older brother to you. I'll put in the effort and become strong enough to protect everyone, so you must survive."

"Can you really do that? Even if you learn Zhongnan's martial arts, you're not exceptionally talented," Jeong Yeonsin chuckled, honestly sharing his thoughts with his elder brother for the first time. It was refreshing. "You'll have to train relentlessly. And take good care of Hye-ah."

"…I understand."

With those words, the Zhongnan Sect masters, his elder brother, and young niece departed for Shaanxi.

Jeong Yeonsin looked back at the chamberlain. "Where will you go, Chamberlain?" he asked.

"I will continue managing the information network I've established throughout Nanyang. As long as the blood of the Jeong Family lives, I will support you all with everything I have," the chamberlain replied.

aggAnnoy10

"Didn't I already say that it's over for the Jeong Family?"

The chamberlain smiled faintly. "The Jeong Family owns a lot of land, not just in Xinye."

Jeong Yeonsin was taken aback. *Was the chamberlain always this devoted to my family?* he wondered, though he felt the late Jeong Family Patriarch didn't deserve such noble loyalty.

He cleared his throat, "Ahem, as you know, I'm heading to the Desolate Fortress. Perhaps we'll see each other again."

"Of course," the chamberlain replied confidently.

"I hope you live a long life, Chamberlain. Take care of yourself."

"You too, Young Master. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors."

Jeong Yeonsin turned and walked away, not looking back.

For a while, the chamberlain watched him go, puzzled. *I hope you live a long life...?* *Isn't that an odd thing to say?*

Jeong Yeonsin sensed the chamberlain's bewilderment, but he chose not to respond. As he hiked down the mountain, crushing leaves underfoot, the fresh air of a new day lifted his heavy heart.

This was Jeong Yeonsin's first time venturing beyond Xinye County, but guided by the chamberlain's detailed instructions, he navigated the main roads effortlessly. Soon, the sun climbed high, casting its light over the bustling dirt road that served as the primary trade route connecting Nanyang in Henan to Xiangyang in Hubei.

There was a problem though. His youthful and delicate appearance attracted considerable unwanted attention.

"That beggar's clothes are unusually fine."

aggAnnoy15

"Isn't that silk? A martial arts uniform made of silk?"

"Silk? But look at him..."

As he walked past, murmurs from a passing escort agency reached his ears. Jeong Yeonsin immediately paused to ensure his backpack was secure, aware of stories where even reputable merchant caravans or escort agencies could suddenly turn rogue. 

*This is troublesome,* he thought irritably, resting a hand on his sword hilt. *Unfortunately, for a jianghu novice like me, the less traveled mountain trails are not an option.*

Out in the wilderness, thieves and bandits were a common menace, and robbery and murder were everyday occurrences.

Still, Jeong Yeonsin quickly learned merely being vigilant wasn't enough. Several freelance swordsmen challenged him, mistakenly assuming he would be an easy target. Employing his Swift Sword Style alongside the Jeong Family Physical Conditioning Method, he dispatched his attackers with ease.

*What were they thinking? They were laughably weak compared to the martial artists of the Thirteen Heavens,* he wondered.

Education, be it academic or martial arts, was a rarity in this world. Therefore, he wasn't surprised that most of the so-called freelance warriors had barely touched the inner arts. What really astounded him was their sheer audacity that surpassed even the warriors of the Thirteen Heavens, who meticulously planned their confrontations.

Jeong Yeonsin sighed. To a master of movement arts, the distance from Xinye to Xiangyang was trivial, yet for him, untrained in such techniques, it was a grueling test of his resilience and mettle.

Nevertheless, it was fortunate that none of his attackers could withstand his rapid swordplay. Moreover, as he cut down enemy after enemy, the Jeong Family Physical Conditioning Method became increasingly integrated into his movements, enhancing his technique beyond simple physical training and transforming his body to better suit real combat.

Before he knew it, a week had passed. Now, his muscles had adapted to explosive bursts of power, his flexibility increased, his sword strokes became so fast they were invisible to his own eyes, and even the amount of qi he could effectively wield increased dramatically.

*Perhaps this is the advantage of mastering a divine art?* Jeong Yeonsin marveled at his progress. Just a few days of enduring the harsh outdoors had significantly honed his skills, and now, Xiangyang loomed ahead.

He smoothly passed through the city gates and stepped into an inn, then exhaled in relief, "Hoo…"

aggAnnoy08

Since the establishment of the Desolate Fortress, Xiangyang had become a bustling metropolis and a major hub in the Central Plains, celebrated for both its immense trade volume and its vibrant culture. Every day, tens of thousands of people streamed through its gates, and countless goods changed hands.

Jeong Yeonsin, having just ordered his meal, listened intently to the lively banter around him.

"Now more than ever! The city is swamped with rowdy young folks. Should've known I'd run out of alcohol," a merchant lamented.

"Truly, people from all corners of the Central Plains have flocked here, chasing dreams of greatness, even those wealthy scions who squander gold like there's no tomorrow."

"Also, these days, the tavern knows neither day nor night. The martial artists here for the entrance exams sure do love their drink!"

"The Desolate Fortress is indeed remarkable."

aggAnnoy20

"Absolutely! Xiangyang was a desolate town before the Desolate Fortress came along, but look at it now… It's literally overflowing with prosperity!"

"Haha, what a way to put it!"

Although Jeong Yeonsin was new to the city, he found himself nodding in agreement with the merchants, especially when he considered the steep prices of goods in town. Even the considerable funds he'd acquired from the Tyrant Sword Sect warrior he killed wouldn't last more than a month here.

Suddenly, a young man with a broad smile, an obviously excellent sword, and an ornate blue headband - an expensive accessory rarely worn except for style - plopped down across from him and asked, "Have you also come to join the Desolate Fortress? ...Ah! Forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself. I was too excited to see a candidate younger than myself. I'm Hyonwon Chang from Shanxi."[^1]

"Jeong Yeonsin, from Xinye in Nanyang, Hebei."

"Oh, that's close! Your trip must have been a breeze. I had sword fights with bandits from the Viridian Forest and participated in a swimming competition with river pirates. Boy, could those guys swim!"

"Well... my journey was easier, I suppose," Jeong Yeonsin vaguely replied.

"Right, so you're here to enter the Desolate Fortress too?"

aggAnnoy06

"…You're from a martial family, aren't you?"

"Let's exchange information and help each other! Few pass the Desolate Fortress exam on their first try. It's mostly prodigies from famous martial families who do. The rest of us might need several attempts."

"There's an exam?"

"Of course! The Desolate Fortress isn't like other sects. Just as one must pass civil or military exams for government positions, there's an exam to enter the Desolate Fortress."

"That explains the crowds..."

"After all, it's a beacon of martial prowess and a place of learning and opportunity where meritocracy trumps lineage. It's only natural that martial artists from all over the world would be drawn to it. Oh, but did you know? Some fools still prefer the traditional sects. Ridiculous! How can a sect founded by commoners be stronger than the Desolate Fortress? If those sects were so powerful, they'd be ruling empires, not just collecting protection money and acting like kings in their own small territories."

"Indeed." Jeong Yeonsin humored Hyonwon Chang, sensing his bitterness toward the traditional murim sects.

"Coming here to take the entrance exam is a smart move... if one can pass, that is..." Hyonwon Chang's face clouded over as he remembered the upcoming challenge.

Jeong Yeonsin blinked in wonder. *How is it possible for someone to change moods so quickly?*

"But if you pass, you'll instantly be hailed as a prodigy among your peers! Especially you! At your age, you'd definitely be recognized as an unparalleled genius!" Hyonwon Chang exclaimed, suddenly excited again.

"…If I can overcome those dauntingly high walls, that is."

"Yes, indeed."

*I'm beginning to tire of this person*, Jeong Yeonsin thought, but just then, his food arrived. After days of meager meals, the modest spread of chicken and vegetables was a welcome sight, and he immediately tucked into his food.

aggAnnoy07

Watching Jeong Yeonsin eat, Hyonwon Chang brought up a suggestion, "So, how about we go to the exam together tomorrow?"

"Sure," Jeong Yeonsin agreed nonchalantly, inwardly relieved that the exam alone was enough for entry to the Desolate Fortress.

Ultimately, he had no desire to seek help from distant relatives he hardly knew. Even at the risk of his life, he was determined not to beg.

{sep}

"Looks like I made a good decision," Jeong Yeonsin remarked, standing in front of the Desolate Fortress after a good night's sleep. Right now, he was no longer just the third son of the Jeong Family Patriarch, but a swordsman and martial artist of the murim.

*Impressive*, he thought, gazing up at the majestic main gate. It was unlike anything he'd ever seen or heard of.

Beside him, Hyonwon Chang murmured as if enchanted, "It's impregnable." 

Jeong Yeonsin silently agreed. The double-layered walls of the Desolate Fortress towered steeply, their edges so distant that they vanished from sight. A moat encircled the exterior, forming a wide belt of water that accentuated the fortress's grandeur. Most strikingly, in a bold statement of confidence from a place that claimed to be the best in the jianghu, the massive gates were swung wide open invitingly, revealing a large training yard.

Jeong Yeonsin stepped forward slowly. "Let's go."

"Yeah."

Together, the two youths approached the front desk, where they provided their personal details. The clerk, dressed like a scholar, wrote down their information and then repeated, "From Nanyang, Henan Province. Jeong Yeonsin of Xinye County, correct?"

"Yes."

"You may enter."

aggAnnoy16

Jeong Yeonsin picked up one of the numerous round tokens piled beside the large desk—it bore the number 13—and looked around him.

*There's really a lot of people*, he noted. The area was bustling, not just with examiners and candidates. 

In addition to young martial artists looking to rise through the ranks, spectators, merchants, and opportunists flocked to the site, but the Desolate Fortress did not make any move to discourage them. In fact, they welcomed the people to come and enjoy the spectacle.

"Over here," an examiner clad in a neat martial arts uniform and radiating an aura rivaling the masters of the Thirteen Heavens shouted.

Jeong Yeonsin and Hyonwon Chang quickly heeded his call.

"For the first test, you will be evaluated on the speed of your attacks," the examiner announced.

"Excuse me?"
