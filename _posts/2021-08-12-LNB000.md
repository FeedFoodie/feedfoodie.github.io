<p class = "testing">Why a sword?</p>

There are so many different weapons in the world, so why did I choose the sword?

That's because swords represent perfection.

A sword has two edges.

One edge to hurt the enemy, one edge to protect me.

It protects me by killing my enemies.

That is the purpose of a sword.

And that is exactly how I use my chosen weapon, my sword.
