"The rumors started circulating through the merchants of the Golden Dragon Trading Company," Myeong Il'oh remarked, his face flushed with excitement at meeting the person who had recently stirred up the entire city.

"The Golden Dragon Trading Company? What kind of rumors did they spread to cause such a commotion?" Baek Suryong asked, puzzled. His ears were still ringing from the cheering crowd that had greeted them so enthusiastically, it felt like the city had exploded.

Even though he was allegedly at the center of the rumors, he hadn't heard any of them and had no idea why their group had been mobbed by the crowds in the city center. If Myeong Il'oh hadn't come out to meet them, they might still be trapped in the sea of people.

"People are saying that you, Hyung-nim, led the students to attack the Valley of Evil, beheaded the Bloody Ripper with a single strike, and then arrested all the villains!" Myeong Il'oh explained, his eyes sparkling.

The corners of Baek Suryong's mouth twitched awkwardly. "What do you mean, a single strike? That's impossible, it's not like I'm one of the Ten Supremes."

Myeong Il'oh gazed at Baek Suryong with respect, envy, and a proud smile as if it was his own achievement. "Well, regardless, you did kill him, didn't you? At first, everyone thought it was just nonsense... until the Rogues' Guild showed up and verified the rumors."

"The Rogues' Guild?" Baek Suryong exclaimed.

Myeong Il'oh nodded. "Yes. The Rogues' Guild revealed that the Scarlet Tiger Boss who kidnapped Wiji Cheon was actually the White-Haired Demon, one of the murim's most wanted criminals, and that he used a hostage to flee after losing to you, Hyung-nim."

"That's not exactly how it happened..."

The White-Haired Demon hadn't actually run away from Baek Suryong, but it seemed the Rogues' Guild had spun the story that way to ensure public opinion favored him upon his return.

*The Golden Dragon Trading Company and the Rogues' Guild, huh. I didn't expect to get help from them. Who would have thought that building connections with the Golden Dragon Chairman and the old woman from the Rogues' Guild would come in handy like this?*

However, that wasn't the end of it.

"In the end, the most credible evidence was provided by Mr. Namgung Su, who returned before you. He personally confirmed the rumors that everyone doubted!"

"Namgung Su did what?"

"He assured everyone that you were definitely the one who killed the Bloody Ripper, Hyung-nim, and staked his own honor on it."

Hearing that Namgung Su had even staked his honor, Baek Suryong blinked in disbelief. Suddenly, he remembered Namgung Su's determined expression when he swore he wouldn't let him get fired.

"Deep down, he must be writhing in agony..." Baek Suryong muttered.

"Pardon?"

"It's nothing," Baek Suryong replied.

In any case, contrary to his expectations, public opinion was positive. From the city gates all the way back to the Azure Dragon Academy, countless people had hailed him as a "chivalrous hero."

Myeong Il'oh asked, "Seriously though, what happened? I knew you were strong, Hyung-nim, but I didn't think you could defeat one of the Ten Great Villains. Wait, now that I think about it, your aura feels different..."

In reality, Baek Suryong's aura had changed considerably, but Myeong Il'oh wasn't sensitive enough to fully perceive it. He simply thought that Baek Suryong seemed more impressive because of the rumors.

Baek Suryong chuckled, "So people are calling me the Azure Dragon Hero now? Did I get a new title?"

"Yes! Do you like it?" Myeong Il'oh nodded, grinning proudly as if he was more excited than Baek Suryong.

Baek Suryong smirked. *The Azure Dragon Hero (靑龍神俠), huh.*

"It's not bad," he said. At the very least, he preferred it over the Hidden Dragon, which he'd heard at the Rogues' Guild before.

"By the way, Hyung-nim..." Myeong Il'oh glanced around warily, then leaned in closer, whispering, "What's this about the Handsome Playboy? That rumor is making the rounds too. You didn't... do anything strange while you were out, did you?"

Baek Suryong raised his fist. "You want to die along with Hyonwon Kang?"

Immediately, Myeong Il'oh flinched and reeled backwards.

*That damned delinquent Hyonwon Kang! I'll make sure he pays for this!* Baek Suryong made a mental note to punish Hyonwon Kang for his crimes.

Sighing deeply, he said, "Anyway, I'm relieved that public opinion isn't as bad as I expected. Looks like I don't have to worry about being fired."

"Fired? You were worried about that? Didn't the guys at the Murim Alliance mention earlier that they're giving you a reward? How could you be fired after that?"

"......" Baek Suryong's brow twitched as he recalled the ordeal he had just gone through.

Upon entering the city just now, he had received an urgent summons from the Murim Alliance, so the group had split up. He went to the Murim Alliance's Jiangxi Branch with Myeong Il'oh, while Mae Geuklyom took the injured students to the Azure Dragon Academy.

*What's the hurry? Can't they even give me the time to go home and unpack…?*

At the Murim Alliance's Jiangxi Branch, Baek Suryong met the Flying Eagle Go Juyeol for the first time in a while.

Celebrating the destruction of the Valley of Evil as if it was his own achievement, Go Juyeol hugged Baek Suryong tightly, laughing, "Hahaha! Azure Dragon Hero! Your father will be so proud! You defeated one of the Ten Great Villains! When did our little Suryong become so strong? Truly admirable, hahahahaha!"

"U-Uncle..." Baek Suryong stammered, struggling to breathe.

After being smothered by Go Juyeol for half an hour, Baek Suryong finally managed to give his report. 

Once he was done, Go Juyeol handed him a letter, saying, "Oh, I nearly forgot. Muheun wrote you a letter, but it seems he accidentally sent it to me instead."

"My father sent a letter? I'll read it later," Baek Suryong replied, tucking the letter into his inner pocket without opening it. He had too much on his mind to read it right now.

*It's probably the same mundane stuff he always writes.*

Anyway, Baek Suryong was now heading to the Azure Dragon Academy with Myeong Il'oh.

"The Principal called for a staff meeting?" he asked.

Myeong Il'oh looked at the sky and checked the time. "Yes. He returned yesterday from the Five Academies' Principals' Meeting and called for a meeting. If we hurry, we'll make it just in time."

Baek Suryong pouted. "I'm going to get scolded by the Principal, aren't I?"

"Most likely, yes."

Although Baek Suryong had boosted the Azure Dragon Academy's reputation by toppling the Valley of Evil, it was an undeniable fact that he had knowingly endangered the students. While Noh Goonsang was generally fond of him, he wasn't someone who would overlook such a grievous fault.

"Come on, with such a great achievement, nothing serious will happen. At worst, you'll get a few months' pay cut and be forced to write an official statement of apology," Myeong Il'oh said with a laugh.

"Don't take it so lightly just because it's not your problem," Baek Suryong retorted.

"Oh, by the way, they'll also discuss the Heavenly Martial Festival today."

"The Heavenly Martial Festival?" Baek Suryong stopped in his tracks and stared at Myeong Il'oh.

"You didn't know? Every year, the school principals decide on matters related to the Heavenly Martial Festival at the Five Academies' Principals' Meeting. The rules change a little each time," Myeong Il'oh explained.

"Hmm..." Baek Suryong nodded thoughtfully. If it was something related to the Heavenly Martial Festival, then he definitely needed to hear it. "We should hurry so we aren't late."

By the time they entered the main conference hall, most of the instructors had already assembled. Judging by the intensity of their gazes, it seemed that everyone had heard the rumors about Baek Suryong.

*They're staring so hard, I feel like the skin on my face is being peeled off,* Baek Suryong thought.

Well, it was inevitable. Leading the students into the Valley of Evil and returning after defeating one of the Ten Great Villains was the Azure Dragon Academy's greatest achievement in the past decade. There was no doubt the instructors' opinion of Baek Suryong would change.

"Ahem, Mr. Baek Suryong…"

"Perhaps we could have tea sometime?"

"I think there have been some misunderstandings between us."

Even the instructors who used to ignore him now wanted to get to know him.

"Sure, let's have tea when we get the chance," Baek Suryong replied callously.

Suddenly, a heavy aura filled the room, drawing everyone's attention to the door. Noh Goonsang, the Principal of the Azure Dragon Academy had arrived.

"Hoho, it seems everyone is present," he greeted, surveying the assembled instructors with a warm smile.

Eventually, his gaze landed on Baek Suryong, and for a split second, his eyes flickered with a peculiar light.

*Did he sense something?* Baek Suryong felt a flicker of unease. Even though he had reached the seventh star of the Heaven Defying Divine Art and was better able to hide his aura, a master like Noh Goonsang could still perceive the subtle changes in him.

"Mr. Baek Suryong," Noh Goonsang said.

*As expected, he noticed.* Baek Suryong stood up, replying politely, "Yes, sir."

Looking him up and down in amazement, Noh Goonsang remarked, "I wasn't sure if the rumors around the city were true, but it looks like you've had quite the fortuitous encounter. Congratulations."

"Thank you."

As expected, the keen perception of a top murim master was truly impressive. Noh Goonsang had quickly realized how much Baek Suryong's martial arts had improved.

"Nevertheless, you must be punished for your thoughtlessness." Noh Goonsang's face darkened and a cold, oppressive air surrounded him. "No matter the reason, an Azure Dragon Academy instructor should never put students in harm's way. If someone were to be crippled or lose their life, there would be no turning back."

"I acknowledge that. It was my mistake," Baek Suryong admitted.

"Your salary will be reduced for three months. Any objections?"

"None at all, sir." Baek Suryong bowed respectfully. The punishment was lighter than he expected. Since none of the students were killed or seriously injured, and because he had greatly enhanced the Azure Dragon Academy's reputation by taking down the Valley of Evil, the penalty had likely been reduced.

"I will ensure this doesn't happen again," he swore.

Noh Goonsang nodded. The stern expression on his face faded and his harsh aura turned as gentle as a spring breeze.

*He's at a level where he can freely control his aura,* Baek Suryong mused. With the advancement of his Heaven Defying Divine Art, he was now able to appraise the true abilities of the masters that he hadn't been able to before.

Noh Goonsang smiled warmly. "Now, we must also give praise where it is due."

"Eh?" Baek Suryong blurted out.

Turning his back on the puzzled Baek Suryong, Noh Goonsang turned to face the group of instructors. His voice, filled with authority, echoed through the hall. "While Mr. Baek Suryong has brought great honor to our Azure Dragon Academy by defeating one of the Ten Great Villains in the Valley of Evil, we cannot overlook the courage of the students who accompanied him. As the Principal, I have decided to reward four students—Geo Sangwoong, Hyonwon Kang, Yeo Min, and Ya Suhyeok—with standard-grade elixirs."

"Elixirs..."

Although it was labeled as standard-grade, since the Murim Alliance supplied the elixir, it was likely the kind reserved for top-tier prodigies, capable of significantly enhancing the students' inner qi.

Baek Suryong quietly clenched his fist. *This will be a huge help to them at their current level.*

However, Noh Goonsang wasn't done yet. 

"In addition to the Murim Alliance reward, the Azure Dragon Academy will also award Mr. Baek with elixirs and a one-time monetary bonus," he announced.

"Thank you," Baek Suryong said. The punishment was much lighter than he had expected, and the rewards were generous. Some instructors seemed displeased, but no one openly objected.

Noh Goonsang added, "We will discuss more in my office after this meeting."

"Yes, sir."

Thus, the matter of rewards and punishments concerning the Valley of Evil incident was settled.

Nodding, Noh Goonsang scanned the room. "Now, onto the main agenda. During the Five Academies' Principals' Meeting, several changes were made regarding this year's Heavenly Martial Festival. To put it bluntly, starting this year, the requirements for participation will be much stricter."

"What?"

"Stricter participation requirements..."

"Though it likely won't affect our academy much..."

The instructors started murmuring among themselves at the unexpected news.

BOOM!

Noh Goonsang stomped his foot to draw everyone's attention back to him. "I am still speaking," he said firmly.

Silence fell as everyone crumpled under the weight of Noh Goonsang's immense aura.

In the now-quiet hall, Noh Goonsang's voice echoed, "The Heavenly Martial Festival has become more violent with each passing year. Crippling injuries are now common, and there have even been deaths. Because of this, we Principals gathered to discuss the problem.

"First, we pinpointed the cause. We realized that putting too much emphasis on martial arts achievements and festival results has left students lacking in both scholarship and character. The Five Academies of murim are supposed to nurture the future of the orthodox sects. If we only focus on martial arts, what makes us any different from the unorthodox faction? The true purpose of the Heavenly Martial Festival has been lost."

Some instructors nodded in agreement, while others frowned in confusion.

Noh Goonsang stopped for a moment, his eyes scanning the room until they finally landed on Baek Suryong. "Starting this year, students won't be chosen for the Heavenly Martial Festival based solely on their martial arts skills. They'll have to compete with others who've passed the evaluations we've long overlooked: character, social engagement, and chivalry."

Character, Social Engagement, and Chivalry.

The names of the three assessments swirled in Baek Suryong's mind. 

*Could those delinquents possibly pass all of these tests? Wait, did Namgung Su already know about this? Ahh, I knew there was something fishy about him! So this is why I got off easy...!*

"Your guidance as instructors will be more critical than ever, so I implore you to pay special attention to the students who are preparing for the upcoming Heavenly Martial Festival," Noh Goonsang concluded firmly.
