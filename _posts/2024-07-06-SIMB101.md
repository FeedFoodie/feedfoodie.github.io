"W-Who are you planning to drive out?" Myeong Il-Oh stammered.

Pung Jinho refilled his empty cup, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. "You heard everything. Why ask again?"

"Is this a joke...?"

"I always enjoy a good joke, but I wouldn't joke about something like this. "

Dumbfounded, Myeong Il-Oh's eyes widened and his hands shook. "So you really plan to oust Namgoong Su...?" he whispered.

"Mr. Pung, what is your plan for getting rid of Namgoong Su?" Baek Suryong asked, leaning forward as if intrigued.

"Aren't you surprised? Damn, it's no fun when a rookie reacts like that."

"Does that mean you don't like me?"

Pung Jinho topped up Baek Suryong's cup and chuckled, "Actually, I haven't liked a rookie this much in a long time."

Pung Jinho had genuinely taken a liking to Baek Suryong, whether it was his striking appearance, his confident demeanor, or his undeniable talent. *This boy is a gem. He could be a future Star Instructor,* he mused, drawing on his experience with many teachers after two decades of teaching. *Baek Suryong has the makings of a popular instructor at any academy, so I must secure his loyalty now.*

"I don't plan to kick Namgoong Su out right away. Maybe next year or the year after. I'll make him leave the Azure Dragon Academy voluntarily."

Curious, Baek Suryong asked, "Why make him leave on his own?"

"Someone has to answer for the Azure Dragon Academy's failures. It looks better that way."

Baek Suryong crossed his arms. "I don't know Namgoong Su well, but he doesn't strike me as someone who would flee because of a few setbacks."

"If he doesn't leave, then we'll force him out."

Pung Jinho's eyes hardened. "As I said, I despise those from the Nine Great Schools and the Five Great Clans. They are born with abundant resources and trained by the best. For them, excellence is just a matter of course."

"Life is inherently unfair, isn't it?" Baek Suryong pointed out.

aggAnnoy11

Pung Jinho burst out laughing. "Exactly, I know that... but those elites? They don't get it. People start life from different places, yet those born with privilege rarely admit it. They credit their successes to their own efforts and dismiss others who haven't achieved the same as lazy and lacking talent, all while pretending they don't understand how good they have it. Well, I'm sick and tired of their hypocrisy."

As a member of a small murim family, Myeong Il-Oh found himself sympathizing with Pung Jinho's passionate words.

However, Baek Suryong felt differently. *I see, he's got an inferiority complex. Although his skills could qualify him as a master, he's still no match for Namgoong Su, so he's convinced himself that his lack of privilege is to blame.*

"Namgoong Su became a Star Instructor after only five years at the Azure Dragon Academy. Is he skilled enough for the job? Yes, but there's no denying that his background in the Namgoong Clan contributed to his quick promotion."

"That's true," Baek Suryong conceded, sensing the need to ease the tension. Refilling Pung Jinho's wine, he steered the conversation back to the main topic, "But I asked about your plan to drive out Namgoong Su, and we've strayed from that."

"Oh, I got a bit carried away. You two, wait outside!" Pung Jinho dismissed the courtesans who were loitering by the door, then lowered his voice, "There are several ways. He could be caught embezzling, rumors might surface about an inappropriate relationship with a female student, or one of his students could suffer qi deviation."

"That's..."

"Just examples," Pung Jinho smiled at a shocked Myeong Il-Oh, then took a sip from the drink Baek Suryong poured. "Here, have another," he said, refilling Baek Suryong's cup as well.

"Thank you," Baek Suryong said, carefully observing Pung Jinho. *This isn't his first time trying to win over a fellow instructor. He's far too practiced, as if he's gone through this routine countless times before.*

Pung Jinho grinned, "Are you sizing me up?"

"Aren't we both?" Baek Suryong replied.

The two men exchanged knowing smiles. As Baek Suryong assessed him, Pung Jinho was likewise gauging Baek Suryong, considering whether he was worth collaborating with. 

aggAnnoy11

In the end, Pung Jinho took the initiative, suggesting, "This isn't a bad offer for you. You and Namgoong Su are already at loggerheads, and you both share a martial arts expertise in swordsmanship. Eventually, you'll need to take over his position."

Baek Suryong nodded silently. Despite Pung Jinho misjudging his expertise, he didn't feel the need to correct him.

Pleased, Pung Jinho continued, "Except for the Heavenly Martial Academy, it's impossible for an academy to have two Star Instructors specializing the same discipline."

"Do you think I can't become a Star Instructor while Namgoong Su is here?"

"Why choose the hard path when there's an easier one?"

"Good point," Baek Suryong chuckled.

[Hyung-nim, are you really considering teaming up with Pung Jinho?] Suddenly, Myeong Il-Oh sent Baek Suryong a telepathic message.

Baek Suryong didn't reply, aware that Pung Jinho would sense the qi waves from any telepathic communication. After a pause, he said, "I'll think about it."

"That's enough for now," Pung Jinho said confidently, convinced that Baek Suryong would come around eventually. *A guy with no real backing other than his grandfather can't refuse me.*

Clearly, no one had bothered to inform him about Baek Suryong's ties to Gongson Su.

"Well then, let's drop the serious talk and enjoy ourselves. Come on in, ladies!" Pung Jinho shouted to the courtesans, who had been waiting outside.

As three women entered and approached them, Pung Jinho nonchalantly tugged one girl over to him and began massaging her shoulders.

aggAnnoy15

Baek Suryong, however, ignored the courtesans. "Mr. Pung, can I ask you one more question? It's nothing big, I'm just curious."

"Go ahead."

"Why do you teach martial arts?"

"For the money," Pung Jinho answered bluntly, his gaze lingering on the courtesan's chest. "Do you think I'm materialistic?"

"Not at all. I value your candor."

"I'm not cut out to be a murim master, and I've got no other skills or talents, so this job fits me well. The pay is good, too."

*Good enough for you to freely indulge in drinks and summon courtesans in a high-end brothel*, Baek Suryong thought.

Finally, Pung Jinho looked away from the courtesan and turned to Baek Suryong. "What about you? Why do you teach?" he asked.

"In the beginning, it was to survive," Baek Suryong replied vaguely. In his previous life, he had damaged his qi center, which was indispensable for a martial artist, while on a mission for the Blood Cult. Since he could no longer fight on the front lines, he had to find another way to be useful in order to survive, so he started teaching martial arts.

"And now?"

"Now, I'm not sure. Money's no longer an issue, and I'm not particularly interested in fame."

"Then why continue?"

Baek Suryong pondered for a moment, then shrugged. "Because it's fun?"

Raising an eyebrow skeptically, Pung Jinho chuckled, "Indeed, that is a dilemma only those without financial worries face. You definitely have the potential to become a Star Instructor."

aggAnnoy08

"I know, right?" Baek Suryong bragged.

Pung Jinho pulled the courtesan onto his lap and burst out laughing, "Hahaha! Your confidence is refreshing!"

"Master, I'm a hostess, not a prostitute..." the woman protested.

Ignoring her resistance, Pung Jinho simply stated, "I'll pay you extra." 

"That's not it..."

"Don't worry, I understand," Pung Jinho replied, brushing off her protests and proceeding to undress her.

"Please, Master, stop...!" The frightened courtesan cried, tears dripping down her cheeks.

Baek Suryong stepped in calmly, "Mr. Pung, if you continue behaving like this, this pleasant gathering might turn sour."

aggAnnoy04

"Damn, now my mood is ruined. Get out!" Pung Jinho roughly shoved the courtesan away.

The courtesan wiped her tears and bowed to Baek Suryong before leaving, and the other courtesans quietly followed her.

Pung Jinho sneered and downed his wine, visibly annoyed by the courtesan's rejection. "Hmph. I'm not interested in soft bodies anyway. A body trained in martial arts is much better, wouldn't you agree?"

"Uh, what?" Myeong Il-Oh blurted out thoughtlessly.

"......" Baek Suryong remained silent, waiting for Pung Jinho to continue.

Pung Jinho licked his lips. Figuring that such topics were acceptable among men, he spoke crudely, "Especially those who are trained from young, they're flexible and strong. It's one of the few pleasures of my twenty years of teaching."

"W-What are you saying...?"

"......"

"Come on. You know what I mean."

aggAnnoy10

Baek Suryong stared at Pung Jinho, narrowing his eyes slightly.

Unfortunately, Pung Jinho misunderstood his expression. "I'm sure you at least understand, right, Mr. Baek? With your looks, it would be even stranger if female students didn't approach you on their own."

"Indeed, I frequently catch them stalking me," Baek Suryong smiled.

Pung Jinho's eyes immediately lit up. "Got any tips to share? How many have you been with?"

*It seems he didn't catch the meaning behind my smile,* Baek Suryong mused, asking, "How many do you think?"

"Hmm, probably over a hundred, I guess? Man, I envy you. If I were young and handsome like you, I'd..."

"Now you're showing your true colors," Baek Suryong interrupted sternly.

"Huh?" Pung Jinho exclaimed, startled by the sudden change in Baek Suryong's tone.

Baek Suryong shook his head and let out a deep sigh. At first, Pung Jinho's talk of uniting the smaller sects appealed to him. Even when they talked about overthrowing Namgoong Su, he could see the logic of survival tactics. However, Pung Jinho's view of his female students changed everything.

aggAnnoy08

"You're absolute trash," he spat.

"Did you just call me trash?"

"Yes, you fucking degenerate."

"Maybe you've had too much to drink..."

Baek Suryong grabbed a bottle and smashed it over Pung Jinho's head.
