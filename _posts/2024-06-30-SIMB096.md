Seemingly intrigued, the Seventh Shroud asked, "You knew I was coming?"

It was a well-known fact in the jianghu that the true fear of an assassin came from the unpredictability of their ambushes. For most assassins, who were primarily trained in stealth techniques, concealed weapons, deadly throat strikes, and escape arts, their ability to kill was greatly diminished once their identity was revealed.

However, this assassin was from Deathshroud. 

Baek Suryong kept his gaze locked on him as he replied, "I knew you wouldn't give up easily, so I prepared a little trap."

"And oh dear, I walked right into it," the Seventh Shroud admitted, his tone unfazed despite his failed strike and revealed identity.

"I suspected this might happen..." Seventh Shroud murmured, rubbing his face. "I thought perhaps you recognized me because the kid's resistance while I skinned him caused some noticeable differences in the face..."

A shiver ran down Gongson Su's spine as he bellowed, "You scoundrel! What have you done to Kang? Is that his face...?"

"Elder," Baek Suryong interjected, calming the agitated Gongson Su who looked poised to attack. "He hasn't harmed Hyonwon Kang."

"How can you be so certain?" the Seventh Shroud asked, tilting his head curiously.

Baek Suryong dismissed his psychological ploy with a laugh, "Elite assassins don't resort to crude human skin masks. Mastering the art of bone contortion and disguise is far more effective."

"That doesn't prove I spared Hyonwon Kang," the Seventh Shroud argued.

"You had to spare him," Baek Suryong retorted, grinning. "Hyonwon Kang needs to be alive for you to frame him after you kill the Elder."

"Oho…" Seventh Shroud nodded in acknowledgment. "Were you an assassin once?"

"It's easy enough to deduce."

"You're quite sharp," the Seventh Shroud observed, sneering.

"I get that a lot," Baek Suryong replied, matching his smirk.

The Seventh Shroud's smile morphed into one of mockery. Despite his failed initial attack, he remained eerily calm as he declared, "For all your cleverness, you've missed something crucial. Even without a surprise attack, I can still kill both of you right here."

A dark mist began to emanate from Seventh Shroud, swiftly enveloping his entire form.

"Ugh…!" Gongson Su gasped, overwhelmed by the formidable aura.

Emerging from a shroud of darkness, the Seventh Shroud's eyes emitted an eerie green glow, his ominous presence seeming to weigh down the air. As he stepped forward, mist swirled at his feet. "Do you know why Deathshroud's assassins are known as the Assassin Kings? It's because our martial arts skills enable us to eliminate anyone, with or without an ambush. For us, assassination is just one method among many for taking a life."

Baek Suryong scoffed, "Quite a bold statement for someone who only showed himself because Namgoong Jaehak isn't present."

"Haha, I acknowledge that," the Seventh Shroud confessed. He had remained hidden during the Black Forest's assault on Gongson Su at the Azure Dragon Academy, all because of the Blue Sky Sword King Namgoong Jaehak.

"There's no shame in doing that. The Ten Supremes are monsters that even Deathshroud's finest can't be sure of defeating. But you, Baek Suryong, are different. I've been observing you these past days. You excel at instructing students, but your martial arts don't quite measure up."

"You were watching me?"

"That day, when the Black Forest assassins came, I saw you fight. You're barely at the threshold of a peak master. Even if you were concealing your true strength, it's not significantly greater."

Baek Suryong's face stiffened, and Seventh Shroud's lips curled into a smile.

"By now, you must realize the insurmountable gap between us."

The darkness cloaking the Seventh Shroud grew denser. As the seventh-ranked assassin in Deathshroud, his prowess was undeniable.

"Huff, huff…" Gongson Su's complexion paled, his breathing became labored, and he faltered, barely able to stand.

Seventh Shroud watched with delight. "Skysword will take a while to arrive. Before he does, I'll kill Gongson Su, frame you, and erase all evidence."

"You fiend..." Baek Suryong gritted his teeth in fury. 

The Seventh Shroud laughed, thriving on his frustration. 

aggAnnoy16

"Mr. Baek... please... leave me and run..." Gongson Su gasped just before collapsing, unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure.

*To knock out a third-rate martial artist with just his aura... he's definitely one of the stronger peak-level masters,* Baek Suryong thought.

"Well then, try to stop me if you can!" The Seventh Shroud taunted as he advanced, thrusting his dagger at Gongson Su's unconscious form.

Then, time froze.

As if in slow motion, an eerie, chilling smile crept across Baek Suryong's pale visage. "The Black Death Demonic Art... It's been a while," he said emotionlessly, releasing a crimson aura to repel the dark fog and disperse the assassin's sword qi.

"What the…?!" the Seventh Shroud gasped, instinctively stepping backward, his eyes widening in shock. 

His hair whipping and clothes fluttering wildly, Baek Suryong laughed, "Do you think you were the only one who needed to hold back in Namgoong Jaehak's presence?"

aggAnnoy02

"Y-You mean..." the Seventh Shroud stammered, panic creeping into his voice. If Baek Suryong was telling the truth, then he hadn't revealed even a fraction of his true power that day.

"The Ten Supremes are indeed formidable. That's why I hid this form from him."

The Seventh Shroud gulped. The moment Baek Suryong activated his aura, his hair turned a brilliant red and his eyes took on the color of blood. *Was there a martial art that could cause such a transformation?* He racked his brain, trying to remember, but under that disturbing crimson gaze, he felt like prey in front of a predator.

Seeing the assassin's confusion, Baek Suryong clicked his tongue. "Tsk, it appears you're not from the Blood Cult."

"Blood Cult...!"

Baek Suryong's grin widened. "So... you do know something, don't you? I think we need to have a serious conversation."

"Just who are you?" The Seventh Shroud's demeanor shifted dramatically, sweat beading on his forehead. Baek Suryong was at least as strong as himself, if not stronger, but that wasn't what truly disturbed him.

*Why? Why is my dark mist shrinking away from his red aura? Why is my heart, steeled by decades of combat, now throbbing with primal fear?*

The Seventh Shroud hadn't even fought yet, but he already felt vanquished.

"Care to hear an interesting tale?" Baek Suryong giggled, brandishing his sword. 

The simple gesture caused the Seventh Shroud to flinch and recoil.

Seeing that his intimidation was working, Baek Suryong channeled more qi into his eyes, intensifying their crimson glow.

aggAnnoy05

His glowing eyes were actually an illusion technique known as the Blood Demon Eyes, which he had recently manifested when his Heaven Defying Divine Art reached the five-star stage, or intermediate mastery, after absorbing the immense contaminated qi and medicinal energies in Gongson Su's body. Unfortunately, as a side effect, activating the Heaven Defying Divine Art now dyed his hair and eyes red, making it impossible to use in secret with others around.

Just days before, he had used these eyes to shatter the spirit of a Black Forest assassin and extract the information he needed. Right now, he could only induce fear in his opponents, but as he improved the technique, he would be able to manipulate minds and create hallucinations.

"Guess who's become the strongest at White Dragon Manor over the last month?" he continued.

"No way..." The Seventh Shroud trembled uncontrollably. The Blood Demon Eyes definitely affected him, but there was something deeper and more disturbing that was bothering him. "Your martial art… Is it a Blood Cult demonic art?"

"Are you sure you've never heard of it? Think carefully." Baek Suryong's smirk grew broader.

Suddenly, something clicked in the Seventh Shroud's mind, and he shuddered violently. "Impossible...!"

> "The legendary Blood Demon has hair and eyes the color of blood, and an aura that overwhelms and suppresses all demonic practitioners."

aggAnnoy09

"The Blood Demon's... martial arts?" he muttered in disbelief.

Baek Suryong brandished his sword again, looking a little impatient. It was obvious that the Seventh Shroud knew something, but he didn't have much time left before one of the Ten Supremes, Skysword, showed up. He needed to make this assassin talk, and fast.

"Hey… Are you going to stand there all day? Didn't you say that Skysword was on his way here? If we're done with introductions, let's get started," he said.

"Wait...!"

Baek Suryong lunged like lightning, his sword tearing through the black darkness of the Black Death Demonic Art.

"We should be there soon," Skysword said.

A man of few words, Skysword had spoken only twice on the journey from the palace, including his last remark, the first being a simple "Let's go.

Known for his reticence, Skysword made sure that the procession to fetch Gongson Su proceeded in near silence.

However, he suddenly stopped riding and furrowed his brow.

"Is something wrong, sir?" Shadow asked.

Skysword ignored her, concentrating on his keen senses that surpassed human capabilities. Not far away, two formidable auras clashed violently, evidence of an intense ongoing battle between two elite martial artists.

His face hardened. "I'm going ahead. Catch up with me as soon as possible."

"Pardon?" Shadow asked again, but Skysword was already gone, leaving his horse behind.

WHOOSH! 

Skysword hurtled across the landscape, his face etched with concern. *I hope the Prime Minister is safe...*

He soon reached the battlefield. Despite the thick darkness that swirled like fog, his vision remained clear, but he still skid to a halt.

"Huh!" he exclaimed in a rare departure from his usual stoicism, gazing at the spectacle before him.

A blood-red dragon tore through the darkness and soared into the sky.
