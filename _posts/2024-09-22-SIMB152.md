When the Bloody Ripper and Baek Suryong collided, a massive surge of qi exploded outward.

RUMMMMMMMBLE!

Any martial artist attuned to qi would have sensed the colossal clash of energies. The students, who had been waiting in their quarters anxiously without lowering their vigilance, all flinched at once.

"Hey, was that...?"

"Did a fight break out?"

"Could it be Mr. Baek?"

Being deep in enemy territory, they kept their senses on full alert.

Hyonwon Kang peered out the door and murmured quietly, "Someone's coming."

Soon, the sound of rushing footsteps echoed from outside, along with shouts of "Don't let them escape!", "You guys, circle around back!", "By order of our King!"

Turning to his juniors, Hyonwon Kang smirked. "I think we're fucked."

They all sighed, nodding in unison, then began stretching and preparing themselves for the impending battle.

Ya Suhyeok placed a reassuring hand on Wiji Cheon's shoulder. "Wiji Cheon, stay behind me."

"...I can fight too."

"It's alright. Just watch us fight today," Ya Suhyeok replied, shoving Wiji Cheon behind him.

CRASH!

Suddenly, the door exploded into splinters, revealing dozens of villains beyond the shattered doorway.

At the front stood the Demon Doctor. Eyeing the battle-ready Zhejiang Five Devils, he chuckled, "Heheh, I knew this would happen. I suspected you guys from the start. Especially that little one."

The Demon Doctor's gaze zeroed in on Wiji Cheon, who peeked out from behind Ya Suhyeok. His eyes gleamed slyly, like a snake's. "You've been poisoned by one of my own concoctions."

"How did you..."

The Demon Doctor pulled out a small vial from his wide sleeve and waved it in front of Wiji Cheon. "Ugh. Did you really think that I wouldn't recognize a poison I made myself? I can recognize it from a hundred steps away just by the smell of it. You guys came to find me for the antidote, right?"

"......"

Anyone could tell that the tiny vial the Demon Doctor waved contained the antidote. 

Hyonwon Kang ran a rough hand through his hair, cursing under his breath, "Damn it. So you lured us here knowing everything from the start?"

The Demon Doctor smirked, shaking his head. "I didn't tell the Bloody Ripper anything. I dearly wanted to see him get stabbed in the back for once, but unfortunately, it seems he figured it out on his own. After wrapping up the banquet earlier, he told me to capture you guys."

"......" The students fell silent. One thing was certain, the Demon Doctor was as twisted as they came. 

Pointing at the Zhejiang Five Devils with a bony finger, the Demon Doctor ordered the villains, "Capture them. I'll use these little rats as test subjects."

"Yes!" the villains of the Valley of Evil acknowledged, charging forward all at once.

Hyonwon Kang drew his blade and quickly commanded, "Ya Suhyeok and I will hold the front. Yeo Min, look for a chance to snatch the antidote from the Demon Doctor. Wiji Cheon, stay back. Once we get the antidote, we make a run for it. Got it?"

"What about Mr. Baek?" Wiji Cheon asked, his face pale.

Hyonwon Kang scoffed confidently, doing his best to act as if there was nothing to worry about. "Don't you remember what he said before we came here? He told us to escape on our own if anything happened."

The other students nodded. After all, the Baek Suryong they knew was someone who could beat up demons in hell with his Black Dragon Pointer and make them repent.

"As long as we don't hold Mr. Baek back, he'll be fine... Watch out!"

Just like that, the students clashed with the villains of the Valley of Evil.

{sep}

BOOM! CRASH! SMASH!

In just a few exchanges, the room was in ruins, as if a tornado had ripped through it.

The Bloody Ripper stepped back, licking his elongated, sharp fingernails. "...You've been hiding more skill than I thought. No wonder Junior Brother was defeated. They call you the Handsome Playboy, but it doesn't seem like you've mastered any seductive arts."

Even though he wasn't going all out, the Bloody Ripper was genuinely surprised. He knew Baek Suryong had been holding back, but he hadn't expected him to block his Blood Jade Claws so effortlessly.

Baek Suryong grinned naughtily and pretended to untie his belt. "Why? Want me to show you? The other guys complained they don't want to see it."

"Hahaha!" the Bloody Ripper laughed in mock amusement, but his true feelings were betrayed by his cold eyes. "...Looks like I need to tear apart that mouth of yours first."

"Wow! Your Junior Brother said the exact same thing before I killed him."

Baek Suryong didn't back down from the trash talk. His opponent was a master against whom he couldn't guarantee victory, even if he fought with everything he had. If messing with his mind could give him an advantage, he was willing to do whatever it took.

The Bloody Ripper charged like a bolt of lightning, swinging his blood-red claws. "Don't worry. I'll fulfill the promise my Junior Brother made in his place!"

SWISH!

Ten crimson lines of claw qi sliced through the air, and Baek Suryong swung Moon Shadow, deflecting five strands of qi and twisting his body to dodge the rest. Still, he couldn't dodge them all, and shallow cuts appeared on his cheek and shoulder.

"You dodge well, like a rat! Try dodging this!" the Bloody Ripper yelled, spreading his arms wide, then clapping them together violently.

BOOM!

As his palms collided, a qi explosion surged toward Baek Suryong. He retreated, hastily forming a sword qi barrier, but the force behind the attack was overwhelming.

"Ugh!" Baek Suryong groaned, crashing through the door behind him and rolling across the floor. 

After a few tumbles, however, he suddenly sprang up and jumped backwards.

THUD!

The spot where he'd just been standing was pierced deeply by the Bloody Ripper's claws.

The Bloody Ripper pulled out his claws, looking slightly disappointed. "Oho, you dodged again. Fine. Try dodging this!"

The Bloody Ripper unleashed a relentless onslaught on Baek Suryong. Crimson claw qi poured from his claws, tearing apart the surroundings. With his hair disheveled like a wild beast and the night sky stained red, he looked like a ghost from a nightmare.

"You boasted you'd send me to meet Junior Brother in hell, but all you're doing is running away!" he taunted.

Ignoring the mockery, Baek Suryong focused on his defense while closely observing his opponent's martial arts. Although the Blood Jade Claws was a technique he'd encountered before, the Bloody Ripper's mastery was on a different level compared to the White-Haired Demon.

*He's definitely strong. I can't beat him while holding back like I did with the White-Haired Demon.*

Baek Suryong's hair gradually turned crimson. Even at the cost of revealing the Heaven Defying Divine Art, he could no longer afford to hide his true powers. 

As expected, the Bloody Ripper's eyes widened in shock. Immediately, he unconsciously screeched to a halt, muttering to himself, "Red hair and eyes? And that aura...!"

The aura of the Heaven Defying Divine Art weighed heavily on his mind. Had he been even slightly weaker, he would have had trouble executing his martial arts, as martial artists who had learned the Blood Cult's techniques instinctively experienced terrible fear in front of the Heaven Defying Divine Art.

Feeling confused, the Bloody Ripper murmured, "No way, no way... It can't beâ€¦"

Sensing an opportunity, Baek Suryong went on the attack.

CLANG!

As their sword and claws clashed, the Bloody Ripper stared intently into Baek Suryong's crimson eyes. 

Suddenly he giggled, "Yeah, it doesn't make sense. There are many martial arts in this vast world. There must be several that cause such phenomena."

He quickly dismissed his initial fears. Convincing himself that Baek Suryong's martial art couldn't possibly be the Heaven Defying Divine Art was more reasonable than believing that the legendary Blood Demon was standing right in front of him.

"Hahaha. You tried to startle me and get a hit in, didn't you?"

Baek Suryong sighed inwardly with relief. *Phew. It would've been troublesome if he started shouting that it's the Heaven Defying Divine Art. Regardless, my situation hasn't exactly improved either.* 

At that moment, the Bloody Ripper's eyes gleamed viciously. "At least I've now confirmed that you're definitely connected to the Blood Cult."

"Who knows?" Baek Suryong let him believe whatever he wanted. There was no way the old man would even consider a ridiculous concept like reincarnation, after all.

"Then you might know how to open that door. No, you must know. After all, from the very beginning, your goal has always been my treasure, right?"

"Think whatever you want."

"How dare you...!" Blood vessels bulged in the Bloody Ripper's eyes, his expression twisting into monstrous rage. Obsession with the Blood Cult's legacy had consumed him for decades, and the thought that it might be taken drove him mad. "Tell me how to open the door! Then I won't kill you, I'll just gouge out your eyes and cut off your tongue."

"Wow, typical demonic scum. You call that a fair trade?"

"Fine, I'll add another reward. I'll keep you by my side and let others serve you for the rest of your life. How about that?"

"Fucking crazy geezer..." Baek Suryong began, when an idea flashed in his mind. Grinning, he said, "The Blood Cult will soon come to retrieve the items. I simply came ahead to check on them."

"I knew it..." His suspicion that the Handsome Playboy was a spy for the Blood Cult confirmed, the Bloody Ripper's expression contorted with rage.

With a solemn expression, Baek Suryong continued, "Bloody Ripper, you've committed the sin of coveting our cult's treasure. Even tearing you apart and feeding you to the dogs wouldn't be enough punishment. However! Since your martial arts skills are useful, we are willing to take you in. The final decision will be left to the higher-ups, but you could easily be promoted to captain. How about it? Stop coveting what's out of your reach and accept my proposal."

*Of course, it's all a lie, but who cares? Whether the Bloody Ripper falls for it or not, I'll be able to buy myself some time to find the entrance to the treasure vaultâ€¦ There it is!*

Even while battling the Bloody Ripper, Baek Suryong kept scanning his surroundings, searching for the hidden entrance to the vault.

"Just a Captain? Don't talk nonsense. I'll tear apart anyone who covets my treasure with these hands," the Bloody Ripper growled, eyes blazing with killing intent. At the same time, a distinct energy formed at the tips of the his claws, different from the sword qi he'd shown so far. 

Seeing this, Baek Suryong murmured softly, "Enhanced Qi..."

Enhanced qi was proof that one had reached the rank of a transcendent master.

*No, wait. He's not completely at the transcendent level.*

On closer inspection, the Bloody Ripper's enhanced qi was somewhat unstable in form, but even unstable enhanced qi was too much for Baek Suryong right now.

"You! Tell me how to open the entrance!" the Bloody Ripper roared, closing the distance in an instant and swinging his claws imbued with enhanced qi.

BOOOOOM!

Baek Suryong hurriedly dodged, and the enhanced qi annihilated the wall behind him. Its destructive power was on a different level than sword qi. If he tried to block it recklessly, his sword would shatter.

Baek Suryong glanced down at his cherished sword, Moon Shadow. *It's a treasured sword, maybe it can withstand a few strikes... but it definitely won't last an entire fight. I'll need the Blood Demon Sword for that.*

WHOOSH!

Baek Suryong used his movement arts, creating more distance between him and his opponent.

"Do you think you can escape? I'll chase you to the ends of hell!" The Bloody Ripper swung his claws imbued with enhanced qi indiscriminately. His massive mansion, built over years, crumbled, and servants and villains around were caught in the destruction.

Baek Suryong dodged the attacks with agility, taunting, "Go to hell alone, you ugly old monster."

"Tell me how to open the door! Before I tear everything apart except your mouth!"

Suddenly, Baek Suryong stopped in his tracks and stuck out his tongue. "With skills like that?"

"You!" Provoked, the Bloody Ripper leaped into the air, spun his body, and unleashed enhanced qi downward.

KABOOOOOM!

The cascading enhanced qi demolished the ground, revealing a hidden space beneath. 

A satisfied grin spread across Baek Suryong's face. "So it was here after all."

He hadn't just been dodging all the time. While evading the Bloody Ripper's attacks, he'd found the entrance to the cave where the Blood Cult's legacy was hidden and maneuvered the fight so that the Bloody Ripper would inadvertently destroy the surrounding area.

Realizing this too late, the Bloody Ripper's face paled. "Impossible..."

With a sinister smirk, Baek Suryong leaped into the hole, shouting, "I'm taking all the Blood Cult's treasure!"

"No!!!" As he hurried to chase Baek Suryong, the Bloody Ripper stopped abruptly. Infusing his voice with inner qi, he shouted loudly, "No one is to follow me! Anyone who dares will be killed!"

After sternly warning the villains of the Valley of Evil, the Bloody Ripper plunged into the hole after Baek Suryong.
