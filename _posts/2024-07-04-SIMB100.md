"Ahahaha! You're quite a character! How do you manage to be so entertaining?" Pung Jinho slammed the table as he laughed uproariously, his face bright red from the alcohol.

Across from him, Baek Suryong casually tilted his glass and smiled. "Mr. Pung, your keen interest makes it all the more enjoyable."

"Yes, indeed. Hahaha," Myeong Il'oh chuckled nervously.

Pung Jinho filled Myeong Il'oh's glass to the brim, causing it to overflow. "You should drink freely like Mr. Baek. Don't worry about the bill tonight, it's all on me."

"O-Okay," Myeong Il'oh stammered, his voice tinged with hesitation.

Noticing his friend's discomfort, Baek Suryong chimed in, "Il'oh, are you really going to overlook Mr. Pung's generosity? Do you see him as a beggar or something?"

"No, Hyung-nim, it's not like that..."

aggAnnoy03

"Then finish your drink and have another one. It'll brighten the mood, please Mr. Pung, and give our evening more meaning."

*And also generate more sales for the brothel,* Baek Suryong thought, imagining his fattening wallet.

"Mr. Baek is right, you shouldn't worry about my finances. After all, aren't we all here tonight to have a good time?"

"Thank you for your generosity. That being said, may I order more drinks and snacks?"

"You don't need to ask me, just order whatever you want."

"Then, I'll go ahead."

Baek Suryong, with a crafty grin, summoned the waiter and ordered the priciest drinks and snacks on the menu.

Slightly startled, Pung Jinho remarked, "Hoho… You're quite bold."

"Should I cancel the snacks if it's too much?"

"Nonsense. Do you think I can't afford a night of drinks for my young juniors?"

aggAnnoy11

Pung Jinho continued to drink, stroking his luxuriously long beard, a source of personal pride that he'd grown over ten years and that he often bragged about to his peers.

Knowing this, Baek Suryong played along, complimenting, "Wow, your beard looks really good on you, Mr. Pung. I'm jealous because I can't grow one well."

"Hoho! Give it time."

"It's just so shiny and silky. Do you have a special beard care routine, sir? Care to share your secrets?"

"Hmm. Well, maintaining good nutrition, regular washing and drying are key, and there's an apothecary I frequent…"

As they emptied several bottles during such trivial chatter, Pung Jinho casually steered the conversation to the main point. "Do you know why I invited only you two tonight?" he asked suddenly.

There were only two temporary instructors sitting at the table: Baek Suryong and Myeong Il'oh. Pung Jinho had told Ak Yeonho and Jaegal Soyeong, who were also at the restaurant, that he would organize a separate evening out for them.

"I have no idea."

"I don't know either."

Both were clueless about their special invitation.

Pung Jinho chuckled. "I hate to say it, but you two don't come from particularly strong teaching backgrounds."

Baek Suryong stayed silent, while Myeong Il'oh frowned slightly.

aggAnnoy04

Seeing Myeong Il'oh's expression, Pung Jinho quickly clarified, "Oh, I don't mean the Myeong Clan is insignificant, but it can't really compare to the Jaegal Clan or the Shandong Ak Clan, right?"

"…That's true." Myeong Il'oh nodded reluctantly, his expression softening slightly.

Pung Jinho nodded in understanding. "I'm in the same boat. Ever heard of the Shaanxi Pung Family?"

Both young men shook their heads.

"Let's have another drink." Pung Jinho filled their glasses again and poured one for himself. He took a hearty swig, then continued, "Do you know which family is most involved in martial arts instruction in the murim?"

"The Namgung Clan," Myeong Il'oh responded promptly, always keen on the dynamics within the murim and the academy business.

"Correct. Then, did you know that the Namgung Clan has over ten renowned Star Instructors?"

"…That many?" Baek Suryong blurted out, genuinely surprised.

Refilling his cup, Pung Jinho explained, "After the fall of the Blood Cult fifty years ago, the murim entered a peaceful era. The unorthodox sects weakened from internal strife, and the orthodox heroes had little trouble with villains. Even the notorious Green Forest Bandits quieted down. But… life always has its ironies, doesn't it?" 

A sly smile formed on Pung Jinho's lips, and his eyes gleamed ominously. "When the unorthodox lose power, so do the orthodox. Who then would protect the common people from the unorthodox sects? And what incentive would civilian merchants have to pay sects for protection? To sum it up..."

Pung Jinho shaped his fingers into a coin. "Having lost an important source of income, the famous orthodox sects and families ran into hard times. To solve their financial woes, they thus set their sights on the martial arts academy business."

aggAnnoy02

"……"

"That's why the Five Great Academies were founded. The orthodox sects claim it's to train the next generation of murim warriors in case the Blood Cult revives, but why would a fallen Blood Cult rise again? It's all a sham."

"……" Baek Suryong had his opinions on the Blood Cult's revival but stayed quiet.

*Pung Jinho is not drunk at all, he just seems drunk. Since the beginning of this drinking party, he's been suppressing his intoxication with inner arts, pretending to be tipsy to set the mood. Damn, he's a real master, not only in martial arts, but in many ways.*

*And he's fucking dangerous.* 

Covertly heightening his vigilance, Baek Suryong kept his composure on the surface and asked innocently, "Really?"

"Ultimately, the establishment of the Five Great Academies was a way for the orthodox sects to make money. That's why I didn't invite Mr. Ak or Ms. Jaegal tonight."

aggAnnoy09

"Mr. Pung, isn't it a stretch to say it's all about money?" Myeong Il'oh suddenly interrupted.

Pung Jinho's gaze turned icy. "After seeing what the Namgung Clan is doing, do you still believe that? And the Namgung Clan is only one faction. What about the Nine Great Sects and the Five Great Clans, who are getting more and more involved in the academy business? Why do you think they're sticking their fingers in the pie?"

"I suppose… you're right."

"Money is the primary motive, and connections are secondary. Today, most talented martial artists attend academies. Traditional one-on-one martial arts training is almost extinct, replaced by systematic training. Now consider this: where do these academy graduates end up?"

Pung Jinho took another gulp before answering his own question, "They move on to higher academies or join sects through referrals. Of course, some find work in escort agencies or trading companies, but the real indicator of success is becoming a formal disciple of a major sect."

*The times have changed more than I* realized, Baek Suryong mused. With the decline of the Blood Cult and the resulting peace in the murim, the motivations for studying martial arts had evolved. He had always focused on teaching martial arts well without much thought for the future of his students, but now he understood that he needed a new approach.

"The academy business has become a way for the orthodox sects to enrich themselves and expand their influence. In the end… the rich just keep getting richer," Pung Jinho continued cynically.

Baek Suryong blinked in surprise. Pung Jinho's attitude was not in line with his expectations. *I thought he was just the second-in-command of the Namgung Su faction… But here he is, openly antagonistic towards the Namgung Clan, which Namgung Su is a part of. Namgung Su doesn't know about this, does he?*

Suddenly, Baek Suryong remembered something Mae Geuklyom had mentioned about Pung Jinho.

aggAnnoy06

> "They call it the Namgung Su faction, but Mr. Namgung is just a figurehead. Pung Jinho is the real authority who shapes public opinion and rallies the faculty."

*Grandpa was wrong; he's more than just a ringleader, he's the mastermind.*

He hadn't thought much of Pung Jinho at first, but now that he saw that icy smile and razor-sharp eyes, the man before him seemed far more cunning and ambitious.

*I see. The reason he called only me and Il'oh here is…* Baek Suryong roughly understood Pung Jinho's intentions.

"I believe the instructors from smaller sects should unite before it's too late," Pung Jinho declared.

"Gulp…" The sound of Myeong Il'oh swallowing was as loud as thunder.

Baek Suryong played dumb, peering into his wine cup. *Ah, so this is how he's trying to bring us to his side.*

"I don't quite understand. What difference would it make if we united?"

"I'm only telling you two this." Pung Jinho smiled eerily, his face no longer showing any signs of intoxication. "The Azure Dragon Academy won't last long."

"Cough, cough!"

"Mr. Myeong, what surprises you so? Surely you've heard some rumors on your way here."

"What do you mean…?"

"At a meeting of the Five Great Academies earlier this year, it was decided that the Azure Dragon Academy won't be invited to the Heavenly Martial Festival starting next year."

aggAnnoy16

"……" Both men's expressions hardened at this new information. 

*Why didn't Noh Goonsang or Mae Geuklyom tell me about this?* Baek Suryong lamented inwardly.

"Participation in the Heavenly Martial Arts Festival alone is highly symbolic. Although the Azure Dragon Academy has been last for ten years, it has remained one of the Five Great Academies because of its inclusion in the Festival."

"…In other words, once we are no longer invited to the Heavenly Martial Festival, the Five Great Academies will become the Four Great Academies," Baek Suryong concluded.

Pung Jinho smiled. "Unless, as you declared, we win this year. Even though I admire your confidence, I'm a very pragmatic person. In my opinion, it's impossible to win the Heavenly Martial Arts Festival, so the Azure Dragon Academy won't be able to take part next year onwards. Once that happens, the Azure Dragon Academy will no longer attract the prodigies of murim. With its reputation and finances dwindling, the academy will be unable to maintain its current scale and will be forced to downsize. If my estimates are correct, it will probably be bankrupt within five years."

Myeong Il'oh immediately turned pale at the chilling revelation.

Setting his glass down, Baek Suryong asked calmly, "Why are you telling us this?"

"Because I want to work with you in the long run. For the next five years, I'll support you."

"…And after five years?" Baek Suryong narrowed his eyes. *Pung Jinho's response to this will reveal his true intentions.*

aggAnnoy03

"I plan to establish a new academy with all my connections and wealth. I'd like to recruit you then."

"……"

"……"

It was a lot to process after one evening of drinking. 

Seeing the duo's complex expressions, Pung Jinho laughed, "Ah, the mood has become too serious. We need some entertainment. Think about my proposal at your own pace."

Before anyone could object, Pung Jinho summoned the dancers.

*No! I haven't gotten enough information out of this bastard yet!* Before the dancers could arrive, Baek Suryong quickly asked, "What if we spread rumors about this tomorrow? What's stopping us?"

With a meaningful glint in his eye, Pung Jinho chuckled, "Would anyone believe the words of a mere temporary instructor over someone who has dedicated twenty years to the academy?"

"If you've been here for twenty years, why aren't you the Principal or Vice Principal?"

"I did have such ambitions ten years ago, but everything changed when the Azure Dragon Academy began to decline." Pung Jinho stroked his beard thoughtfully before downing another drink. "When the academy fails, someone has to take the blame. The Principal first, the Vice Principal second, and…"

Understanding his implication, Baek Suryong finished his line for him, "The Star Instructor would be next on the chopping block."

"Exactly. It's good to talk with someone who understands." Pung Jinho continued drinking, his movements as cold and calculating as a snake deliberately ingesting poison. 

Finally, wiping his mouth with his sleeve, he suggested, "So, I was thinking… Why don't we drive Namgung Su out of the Azure Dragon Academy?"
