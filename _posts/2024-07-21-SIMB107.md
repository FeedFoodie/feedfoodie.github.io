"Hahaha! Is that all you got?" Geo Sangwoong's hearty laugh echoed through the inn, deep and assertive.

"Ugh..." On the other side of the table, Geo Sangwoong's opponent groaned as he struggled to move Geo Sangwoong's massive finger.

Although Geo Sangwoong was arm-wrestling with just one finger, his entire hand and arm remained immobile no matter how hard his opponent pushed.

"Yawn! This is boring," Geo Sangwoong yawned as he easily pushed the man's arm down.

BANG!

The table shook violently, as if it were on the verge of breaking. 

The man, briefly flung into the air, hit the ground foaming at the mouth. "Keuk! My bones... I think they're broken..."

"Don't exaggerate. Your muscles are just in shock," Geo Sangwoong said with a dismissive wave of his hand. The onlookers, used to this sort of scene, helped the man to his feet.

Geo Sangwoong grabbed a piece of meat from the pile beside him and chewed thoughtfully while scanning the room. "Is there no one else? I'll give ten silver coins to anyone who can bend my finger," he said, wiggling a finger as thick as three normal sized ones.

"It's only one finger. Is there no real man around here? Tsk tsk," he clicked his tongue. 

A few men bristled, but didn't step forward. More than ten men had already tried and failed to defeat him.

"No one here can bend that finger."

"He beat thirty men in a row with just one finger?"

"This guy could take on a bear in an arm-wrestling match."

Staring at Geo Sangwoong, the onlookers whispered in awe. He was a giant, towering over everyone with a body that easily weighed several hundred pounds. His flesh looked soft, but anyone who touched it would find it hard as steel.

"Is there really no one else? Tsk. Waiter! Bring me more meat!" Geo Sangwoong shouted, devouring the pile of meat beside him. As he had defeated dozens of men with raw strength and no inner arts, he was still full of energy.

"Hey, Sangwoong."

"Hm? Oh, Senior Yang."

A man with a goatee who had known Geo Sangwoong for years approached and sat down across from him. "Why haven't you been to the gambling den lately? Have you been spending all your time at the inn, just eating and arm-wrestling?"

Geo Sangwoong answered, chewing, "Most bets bore me now. Sometimes, a simple game like this is more fun."

"Where's the fun in arm-wrestling when you always win? Gambling without stakes is dull."

aggAnnoy18

"Who knows? Maybe someone who can beat me will come along," Geo Sangwoong waved his hand, chuckling. "Anyway, I'll swing by the gambling den when I get bored. It's just across the street. Right now though, I want to eat."

Senior Yang, who had ordered a bottle of wine, left the table with a sigh. "Stop wasting your time here. Come and play with us. Everyone complains that it's no fun without you."

"Yeah yeah. 

Now go."

With Senior Yang gone, Geo Sangwoong turned his attention back to the food piled in front of him.

"Hey."

"What now?" Geo Sangwoong looked up irritably, only to find a huge shadow looming over him.

It was a teenage boy as tall as him, but with a much more youthful face. Looking down at him, the boy said, "I heard that you're offering ten silver coins to anyone who can beat you in an arm-wrestling match."

"...Oho." Geo Sangwoong's eyes widened. "You seem to be about my size. This could be fun."

Geo Sangwoong pushed back his chair and stood up. The two massive men faced each other, filling the room with their presence.

Geo Sangwoong smiled. "I haven't seen you before. What's your name?"

"Yasu Hyeok," the boy replied, shrugging off his outer coat to reveal his muscular arms and body. His smooth, tanned skin gleamed, accentuating his impressive physique.

aggAnnoy09

Geo Sangwoong laughed, "If I use just one finger against you, I'll lose."

It wasn't about saving money. He simply felt that it would be a waste to face such a worthy opponent with only one finger.

"I don't want to break my finger and become a cripple," Yasu Hyeok agreed. He sat down and placed his entire wallet on the table with a grin. "How about this? If I win, give me a hundred silver coins. I'll bet my entire fortune."

"What? Hahaha! Sounds good!" Geo Sangwoong burst out laughing and sat down.

The tension rose as the two giants faced each other across the table. When they clasped hands, the onlookers held their breath.

"...Shall we start?"

"...Let's do this."

There was no need for a third party to give the starting signal. The moment they exerted their strength, the table groaned and began to split.

"Urgh..."

"Ungh..."

Their arm muscles bulged, veins popping out as their faces flushed red from the effort. Their bodies and arms shook violently as they used every ounce of their strength. The floor shook and the table wobbled madly. Finally, the table broke apart with a loud crack, and both men released their grip simultaneously.

"Hoo... Hoo..."

aggAnnoy16

"Haa... Haa..."

Looking at each other in astonishment, they panted heavily.

Geo Sangwoong spoke first. "It's a draw."

Yasu Hyeok shook his head. "I heard that you defeated dozens before I arrived. That makes it my loss."

Yasu Hyeok picked up his wallet from the floor and handed it to Geo Sangwoong. Geo Sangwoong took it, but his expression was sour.

"Those dozens barely counted," he complained.

"It doesn't matter. I feel like I lost, so I lost. Damn it!" Yasu Hyeok snapped, still fuming over his defeat. 

aggAnnoy10

Geo Sangwoong found himself liking the young man's spirit, but at the same time he felt a pang of bitterness. *Man, does he remind me of my younger self.*

Opening the wallet, Geo Sangwoong emptied out several copper coins, barely worth a single silver. Immediately, he broke into uncontrollable laughter, "Hahaha! I thought your wallet was heavy, but it's just weight without value. Did you scam me? Hm? What's this? The Azure Dragon Emblem?"

Inside the wallet was a sparkling, brand-new Azure Dragon Academy emblem.

Chuckling, Geo Sangwoong handed the emblem back to Yasu Hyeok. "You're a junior, huh?"

"Are you also a student at the Azure Dragon Academy?"

aggAnnoy18

"Would you call me Senior if I showed you my emblem?"

"I'll think about it."

Although Yasu Hyeok's expression was sullen, Geo Sangwoong patted his shoulder merrily, finding it endearing. That said, a normal person would have suffered a fractured shoulder under the force of Geo Sangwoong's pats, but Yasu Hyeok only looked slightly annoyed.

"Hey, do you like meat?"

"Of course I do."

"Then..." Geo Sangwoong was about to offer to pay, but his mouth betrayed him, "How about we bet on who can eat more meat this time?"

"I'm broke."

"Then how about the loser becomes the winner's servant for three days?" Geo Sangwoong suggested.

"You'll regret it," Yasu Hyeok replied, his competitive spirit ignited.

aggAnnoy13

"Waiter! Bring us two whole roasted pigs!"

Soon, the two men sat opposite each other, each tearing into a tasty roasted pig.

"Hahaha! I've never met a junior I can get along with so well! Why didn't you enter the school earlier?" Geo Sangwoong laughed, pounding Yasu Hyeok's back.

It was a gesture meant to help with indigestion, but his strength was enough to break an average person's back.

"Ugh... Stop it... I'm fine now..." Yasu Hyeok groaned, looking pale and nauseous.

"Damn it... I lost again."

"Haha! I'm better at eating than arm-wrestling," Geo Sangwoong bellowed, his massive belly shaking with mirth.

Although they were similar in stature, Geo Sangwoong outweighed Yasu Hyeok by several dozen pounds and was also an inch taller.

*I'm still a little taller than him, but I'm sure he'll outgrow me one day. I'm a little jealous, if I could go back in time, I wonder if things could have turned out differently... No, what's the point of thinking about such things anymore...* Geo Sangwoong thought bitterly. At twenty, he had already stopped growing, but Yasu Hyeok, being only seventeen, was still in the middle of his growth spurt.

Unaware of Geo Sangwoong's thoughts, Yasu Hyeok wiped his mouth. "Fine, since I lost the bet... I'll be your servant for three days."

"No need. Just go."

"What?"

"I said, just go. I had a great time today, so let's call it even. Take this too." Geo Sangwoong gave Yasu Hyeok's wallet back in a gesture of generosity.

aggAnnoy18

However, Yasu Hyeok did not see it that way.

"You bastard... Are you mocking me?" Yasu Hyeok growled, his aura becoming predatory.

Geo Sangwoong was taken aback. "Mocking? When did I mock you?"

"Do I look like a beggar to you?"

"No, I just thought you could use some help..."

"You son of a...!"

Suddenly, Yasu Hyeok swung his fist, and Geo Sangwoong was barely able to dodge it.

CRASH!

His fist smashed through the inn's wall. 

Geo Sangwoong's expression hardened. "Have you lost your mind?"

While usually calm, Geo Sangwoong's temper was no joke. His fist met Yasu Hyeok's as they clashed with a sound like rocks being smashed together.

"Die!"

"You arrogant brat!"

aggAnnoy03

They fought fiercely, kicking, throwing, and thrashing around. The inn's furniture was destroyed, and people fled in panic.

Bruised and bloody, they stood up and glared at each other. Remarkably, neither of them had used any inner arts, fighting purely with muscle strength.

"Hoo... Hoo..."

"Haa... Haa..."

The two paused for a moment to catch their breath, then moved simultaneously, charging at each other with full force. At that moment, they knew that one of them would be seriously injured, but it was too late to stop.

aggAnnoy03

"Die!"

"You bastard!"

Suddenly, a third person stepped between them, catching their fists and stopping them effortlessly.

"Enough," the newcomer said.

"!!"

"!!"

The two burly young men stared at the person who had intercepted their blows. Though taller than average, the man looked like a skinny child compared to them.

"This must be my lucky day," Baek Suryong smirked. "Now I don't have to look for both of you separately."
