"Grandpa, over here!" I smiled broadly and waved at the old man.

Mae Geuklyom pouted. He could probably tell that I was acting like this on purpose to elicit some kind of response from the crowd, and as expected, they erupted.

"G-Grandpa, he said?"

"What did he just call the Headmaster?"

"Impossible…"

The students' eyes widened in disbelief as they stared at the two of us with eyes that said, "There's no way, right?"

"My grandson invited me to dinner, so I came… What's going on? Aren't these students from our school?" Mae Geuklyom hammered the final nail in the coffin. 

"!!" Mae Geuklyom's admission blew the students' hesitation out of the water. The quick-thinking male students hastily picked up the liquor bottles around them, while the female students with torn skirts hid behind the folding screens and got changed.

As they busied themselves, the students whispered in hushed but flustered tones.

"Did the Headmaster have any grandchildren?"

"I don't know. He never talks about himself."

"Damn, that new instructor never made any mention of this on the interview paperwork."

"I'm going crazy. We were just having some fun, so why…"

With the arrival of the constables and the Headmaster, what started out as a joke was now way out of hand.

"Fuck…" As the seriousness of the situation dawned upon him, Peng Sahyuk's composure vanished and he broke out in cold sweat.

*To make Peng Sahyuk shit his pants, just how scary is the Headmaster? Even I'm starting to panic…*

Meanwhile, Mae Geuklyom's eyes narrowed at the chaotic scene. "Looks like you kids have gotten yourselves into trouble," he stated coldly.

He twitched a white eyebrow, and the students' bodies squirmed like they were about to have a seizure.

*...Dang, the intimidating Blood Cult Devil Instructor that I was in my past life was nothing compared to this terrifying old man.*

Mae Geuklyom turned his attention back to the constable guarding the door and said, "I'm the Headmaster of the Azure Dragon Academy. I oversee student welfare and discipline, and it seems that our children have caused trouble here… So would you mind letting me through?"

aggAnnoy01

The constable gave Cheong Cheon a confused look, and Cheong Cheon in turn glanced at me for instruction. I gave him the barest hint of a nod, and he said to his subordinate, "Let him enter. Since the offenders this time are students, it is only right that we seek the aid of their custodians."

Mae Geuklyom walked into the inn and examined the mess around him. The occasional student who made eye contact with him either gulped in horror or hung their heads in shame, shivering.

The prospective instructors were no different. Everyone stood with their backs ramrod straight and their hands clasped together as if they were guilty.

Only Kwak Duyong stumbled around drunkenly for a bit before falling unconscious.

"Tsk tsk," Mae Geuklyom clicked his tongue and shot me a meaningful glance before turning to Cheong Cheon. "Head Constable, would you mind telling me what these kids have done wrong?"

"Of course not."

GULP.

aggAnnoy02

The sound of someone gulping rumbled like thunder as Cheong Cheon summarized the events that had just transpired. 

To my surprise, when he was done, Mae Geuklyom appeared fairly calm. "...To summarize, the kids drank alcohol illegally and vandalized the inn. They then tried to bribe you, the Head Constable, but when that failed, they threatened you," he concluded.

"A-About that, Headmaster…" Peng Sahyuk started.

However, before he could finish making excuses, Mae Geuklyom interrupted, "Also…"

The old man turned toward Peng Sahyuk, his placid face slowly twisting into a grimace. "Peng Sahyuk, the girls have torn skirts, some of the boys have bleeding lips, and yet you use your family name to shift the blame to someone else?"

ROOOOOOOAR!

An intangible force emanated from Mae Geuklyom's body and paralyzed the students.

"Punks! How dare you still call yourselves students of the Azure Dragon Academy!"

aggAnnoy17

SHIVER SHIVER. RATTLE RATTLE.

While the other students cowed, Peng Sahyuk, the Young Master of the Peng Clan, clenched his teeth to prevent them from chattering.

*If I remember right, his title was "Sword Addict"...* I knew the old man was strong, but it was only now that I sensed the full extent of his strength. *He's either at the pinnacle of the Peak Realm or has just reached the Supreme Peak.*

"I will meet all of you individually after you return to your dorms."

""...Yes, Headmaster."" All the students, including Peng Sahyuk, replied despondently. None of them dared to defy the old man.

Mae Geuklyom let out a long sigh and looked back at Cheong Cheon.

"Head Constable."

""……"" The blood drained from the normal constables' faces. Despite the fact that Mae Geuklyom had focused his aura on the students, the spillover alone was enough to make most cower in fear. 

Even Cheong Cheon, for all his courage and audacity, observed Mae Geuklyom warily. "...I'm listening," he acknowledged.

*Now this...This is the intimidating aura of a real martial arts expert, unlike Peng Sahyuk who only relies on his family's name. They're on completely different levels.*

Suddenly, Mae Geuklyom, whose presence completely dominated this space, bowed deeply to Cheong Cheon. "My students have done something unsavory. It's my fault for failing to teach them properly, so I'll take responsibility for what they've done." 

""……"" Everyone was shocked speechless. The students looked like terminally ill patients, while the prospective instructors stared blankly in disbelief. 

aggAnnoy03

I was no less surprised than them. *A martial artist of that caliber, bowing down to another? That's not something you see often, even in the orthodox sects!*

Cheong Cheon took some time to compose himself, then asked, "How are you planning to take responsibility…?"

"Arrest me in their stead. When children misbehave, it is the fault of their parents first and their teachers second. Since these children's' parents have entrusted them to the Azure Dragon Academy, however, all the fault lies with me."

"……"

*Damn, that's even more impressive… Before Mae Geuklyom is a powerful martial master, he's a teacher.*

"So cool…" Ak Yeonho swooned.

"Wow…" Myeong Il-Oh gaped.

Several of the other prospective instructors also clenched their fists in respect.

"Erm…" Cheong Cheon pretended to look around, but in reality, he was watching for my signal.

aggAnnoy12

When his gaze swept over me, I mouthed, 'End this with a warning.'

Cheong Cheon frowned for a moment, then sighed resignedly and said, "Now that you have reminded me, I am ashamed of myself for scolding children. I will let you off with only a warning, which is within the limits of my authority. Please guide your students well so that such things don't happen again."

"…Thank you for your consideration, Head Constable."

Mae Geuklyom straightened his back and glared at the students with the eyes of a death god. "Follow me," he commanded.

Before they left, I couldn't help but interject, "Ahem! Thanks to you kids, the innkeeper has suffered great losses. Don't you think he should be compensated?"

I felt a prickle of killing intent behind me (presumably from Peng Sahyuk), but I ignored it and blinked at Cheong Cheon. Naturally, the righteous constable agreed with me.

"Of course, the innkeeper should be compensated appropriately."

aggAnnoy05

"I agree. Please report the damages to the Azure Dragon Academy…"

"I'll pay for all the damages," Peng Sahyuk insisted.

I made a mental note of those words and smiled wryly. *Yay! Look forward to your bill, brat.*

Meanwhile, Mae Geuklyom and Cheong Cheon, who somehow seemed to have taken a liking to each other, exchanged glances.

"If you would excuse me, I'll be leaving with my students."

aggAnnoy14

"Sure, farewell."

Right before leaving the inn, Mae Geuklyom shot me a quick glance and said, "I'll see you later. Alone."

"Okay! Take care, Grandpa!"

"...Ahem." Mae Geuklyom rubbed his temples in dismay, then strode out of the inn. With expressions like prisoners on death row, Peng Sahyuk and the students trailed after him.

"From now on, we will be vigilant. If something similar happens again, we will arrest you immediately," Cheong Cheon warned the remaining instructors before also taking his leave.

"Phew…"

"Ugh…"

The prospective instructors simultaneously released the breaths they had been holding, and some sank to the floor as soon as their tension was completely released.

"Hyung-nim! Why didn't you tell us that the Sword Addict was your grandfather?"

POKE. POKE. PROD.

Ak Yeonho relentlessly poked me in the side. 

I slapped his hand away and said, "I was going to tell you when the time was right, but didn't you say you weren't afraid of the Headmaster? You were scared shitless."

Actually, the fact that Mae Geuklyom frightened everyone surprised me more than anything else. I thought that the heir to the Peng Clan might be able to stand up to him, but I couldn't be more wrong. The instant Mae Geuklyom appeared, the entire situation was resolved.

aggAnnoy20

Ak Yeonho gave me a dubious look and said, "Didn't you know? The Sword Addict was one of the leaders of the previous generation."

"What about it? It's not like everyone's terrified of him because of his martial arts, right?"

Myeong Il-Oh answered my question, "Being strong is one thing, but more importantly, in his youth, he was friends and comrades with people who are now grand elders and grandmasters of large sects and clans. Do you get what that means?"

"Ahh…" In other words, my maternal grandfather could be sworn siblings with the Peng Clan's retired Clan Head. *Dang, this guy is more amazing that I imagined!*

I relaxed my stiff shoulders. "You should watch out from now on. A man like that is my maternal grandfather."

aggAnnoy09

"Ugh, I feel like 10 years of my lifespan has been shaved off… Earlier, when you insensitively demanded compensation for damages, I nearly freaked out…"

"That surprised me, too. Why did you bring that up all of a sudden?"

*Hoho. Of course I wouldn't suggest something so petty without good reason.* With a huge grin, I said, "The innkeeper, Heo Cheon, is my acquaintance."

As we chattered away, the last of the constables left the inn, leaving only the prospective instructors behind. One by one, they also started to walk out, but I called them back, shouting, "Gentlemen, before you go, let me say a few words."

I took a moment to memorize each of their faces, especially those who had helped Peng Sahyuk frame Ak Yeonho and those who had looked offended when I slapped Peng Sahyuk for his insolence. Of course, there were also the apathetic bystanders who were upset by Peng Sahyuk's actions but did not have the courage to speak out, instead keeping their heads down and waiting for everything to blow over.

I had only one thing to say to such people. "Shame on you, cowards. Do you still think you're qualified to be teachers after what you've done?"

"……"

I spun around and stormed out of the inn. A few people started muttering incomprehensibly behind me, but I didn't give a shit.

The next day, I put on my Heo Cheon mask and went to meet Bok Manchun.

"Good morning," he said, bowing his head in greeting, before briefing me on the events of last night. As the manager of all my businesses, it came as no surprise that he had already heard about the incident.

aggAnnoy09

"There was a mishap at our inn involving students from the Azure Dragon Academy…"

After listening to an abbreviated version of the story (Bok Manchun didn't seem to know about it in detail), I said, "Demand ten times the cost of repairing the damage as compensation." 

"Yes, I was already thinking of doing that… Wait, what?" Bok Manchun's jaw dropped.

I repeated myself, but Bok Manchun still seemed uneasy. "The… The Peng Clan's Young Master is the one paying compensation. I think it's fine if we ask for double, but…isn't ten times a bit much?" he asked.

As Peng Sahyuk was the heir to the Peng Clan, one of the Five Great Clans, even if he was the one at fault, normal people still couldn't afford to take advantage of him. However, that was not the case this time.

aggAnnoy04

"In the message to Peng Sahyuk, add this line: If you don't compensate me ten times the cost of fixing the damage, I'll send the bill to the Headmaster of the Azure Dragon Academy."

"Okay, but how does the Headmaster even factor into this…?"

A tenfold compensation was a large amount even for the Young Master of the Peng Clan, especially since I had deliberately chosen the most expensive food, drinks, and furnishings for yesterday's party.

*He'll be eating his meals in the school dorms for a while.*

I placed Peng Sahyuk at the very top of my "Students I Need to Rehabilitate Once I Join the Azure Dragon Academy" mental list. 

"Oh, and there's something else I need to tell you." Bok Manchun smiled confidently, then continued, "I've found the spiritual herbs and the black market that you asked me about."
