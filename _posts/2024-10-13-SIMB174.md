Once their secret deal was settled, Tang Soso turned to Baek Suryong. "Mr. Baek, I'm sorry, but could you step outside? I'd like to speak with Senior Hyonwon Kang alone."

Baek Suryong raised an eyebrow. "Just the two of you?"

"We're not going to discuss anything confidential," she reassured. "I just think it'll be hard to have an honest conversation with you here. Don't worry, I'll fill you in later."

Seeing she was serious, Baek Suryong nodded and stood up. "Alright then. Wonkang, when you're finished, head straight home and don't get sidetracked."

"Where would I even go?" Hyonwon Kang mumbled under his breath.

"I can hear you, dumbass. Anyway, I'm off," Baek Suryong said, giving Hyonwon Kang a light smack on the back of the head before disappearing out the inn's door.

The two students remained silent until they were sure he was gone. They didn't know each other before today, and under normal circumstances, they'd have no reason to meet.

Once Baek Suryong was out of earshot, Tang Soso friendly demeanor quickly turned into something more businesslike. "I'll support you from behind the scenes, Senior Hyonwon Kang, but to be honest, your chances of winning this election are nearly zero," she said matter-of-factly.

"What? That's not what you said earlier!" Hyonwon Kang blurted, taken aback by the sudden change in Tang Soso's tone.

With an elegant flourish, Tang Soso raised her teacup to her lips, appearing completely different from the depraved girl who had perversely sniffed a used blanket moments before. 

Or rather, this cool and composed noble lady was the real Tang Soso.

"Before we even start planning your election campaign, you have to face the facts," she explained. "There are only ten days left until the election, and your opponent is none other than the Willow Blade Seonwoo Jin, the most popular figure in the Club Union. After Senior Peng Sahyuk suddenly left for the Heavenly Martial Academy, he's the one who brought stability back to the Union. People respect him a lot for that."

Hyonwon Kang retorted gruffly, "So what?"

"Senior Hyonwon Kang," Tang Soso said sternly, fixing her gaze on him.

"Yeah?"

"With such an outstanding candidate in the race, why would anyone choose to vote for you?"

"...What?"

Tang Soso carefully observed Hyonwon Kang's reactions. She was well aware that the odds of this gamble paying off were slim, so she had deliberately provoked Hyonwon Kang to see what kind of person he really was. Moreover, as a daughter of the Sichuan Tang Clan, the most ruthless of the Five Great Clans, she would never hesitate to exploit an opponent's weaknesses if necessary.

After all, as the saying goes, 'if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles.'[^1] She knew a fair amount about Seonwoo Jin, but not much about Hyonwon Kang. Besides, he seemed quite different from the person she had heard of in rumors.

"If you're doing this on a whim, you should quit now," she said sharply. "Over the next ten days, you'll be insulted, humiliated, and blamed for things you never did. Your name will be dragged through the mud. Can someone like you take that? Are you ready for what's coming?"

"You..."

"Although Senior Peng Sahyuk was infamous for being a scoundrel, he had the authority and leadership to unite people. His martial arts were also formidable. So, what strengths do you have to offer?"

"Peng Sahyuk again?" Hyonwon Kang's face contorted with anger, insulted by the comparison.

Although she was somewhat unnerved, Tang Soso pressed on, "You're a rowdy thug who picks fights with impunity, your personality sucks, and your martial arts skills are unproven. Oh, and everyone knows that Senior Peng Sahyuk beat you to a pulp."

BANG!

Hyonwon Kang slammed the table and glared at Tang Soso, his eyes burning with rage. "Hey, are you messing with me on purpose?"

*What an intense killing intent!* Tang Soso winced on the inside, but her expression, tempered by years of strict training, stayed calm and composed on the surface.

"Hooo..." Hyonwon Kang exhaled deeply to quell his anger. 

*How long has it been since someone my age insulted me to my face? Most students either avoid my gaze, ignore me, or keep their distance from me. Aside from that bastard Peng Sahyuk, I can't even remember the last time someone openly tried to provoke me.*

After regaining his composure, Hyonwon Kang said, "Look, I don't know why you're trying to rile me up, but since you asked, I'll be honest. Why am I running for president? I got upset at that asshole Seonwoo Jin and decided to do it on the spur of the moment. Then, after telling Mr. Baek about it, I mysteriously found myself handing out fleeceflower juice in front of the Club Union building the very next day." 

Hyonwon Kang chuckled, as if he himself found the story absurd, but his expression remained grave as he continued, "Am I prepared? Not in the least. The pledges I made were just things that Mr. Baek forced me to memorize. Hell, I don't even fully understand what the Club Union does. I'm just being forced into this."

"...So you don't actually want to do it?" Tang Soso asked.

Smiling bitterly, Hyonwon Kang admitted candidly, "No. If you ask me, I'd rather swing my blade until I collapse from exhaustion. This sort of thing isn't for me."

"Then why..."

"Because he said it's necessary. He told me that if I take over the Club Union and can influence the students, my friends and I will have a better shot at qualifying for the Heavenly Martial Festival."

"Who?"

"Who else? There's only one person who always smacks me on the back of the head."

"Mr. Baek Suryong? Are you doing this simply because he told you to?"

Hyonwon Kang shook his head. "No, that's not the only reason. Although my personal goal is to beat Peng Sahyuk and win the Dragon and Phoenix Tournament, that's not enough to guarantee that the Azure Dragon Academy will win the Heavenly Martial Festival, isn't it?"

Tang Soso nodded. "You're right. Even though the Dragon and Phoenix Tournament holds the most points, when you add up the scores from all the events, it's possible to lose the festival despite winning that one tournament."

"Exactly. It's not enough for just me to excel. Everyone in the Azure Dragon Academy has to perform well for us to win the Heavenly Martial Festival. That's the only way we can fulfill that man's wish," Hyonwon Kang said confidently, as if his own victory was a foregone conclusion.

Despite finding the situation a bit absurd, Tang Soso didn't argue. Instead, a small smile tugged at her lips as she asked, "Let me get this straight, you want to become the Club Union President to help Mr. Baek achieve his dream?"

Scratching his head sheepishly, Hyonwon Kang admitted, "He always knocks me around and beats me up, but to me, he's a lifelong benefactor."

"......"

*If I hadn't met Baek Suryong, would I still be wasting away my days, drowning in alcohol?* Hyonwon Kang wondered, even as he said, "Anyway, resolve? Determination to become Club Union President? I don't have that. Still, that doesn't mean I'll do this half-heartedly. I'll grit my teeth and get it done, because I want to repay even a little of his kindness."

Hyonwon Kang words resonated deeply with Tang Soso. 

"You're a fine student. If Mr. Baek were to hear what you just said, I'm sure he'd be very proud," she commended.

Feeling goosebumps crawl up his skin, Hyonwon Kang rubbed his arms. "This is super embarrassing, so don't you dare tell him."

Even though their conversation was brief, Tang Soso felt she understood Hyonwon Kang a bit better now. Giggling, she remarked, "Hehe, you're actually kind of cute."

"Don't say that. You're scaring me. Seriously."

"You know, if it weren't for Mr. Baek Suryong, I might have fallen for you."

"I'll count myself blessed that he stole your heart, then."

After their candid talk, the atmosphere relaxed considerably.

*Senior Hyonwon Kang. He's definitely different from what I knew... No, he's changed,* Tang Soso mused.

The past Hyonwon Kang was both aggressive and sensitive. He always had his guard up, and if someone so much as bumped into him, he'd lash out in every direction. However, after meeting Baek Suryong, he had begun to change, not only in his martial arts skills, but also in his personality.

Hyonwon Kang grinned wickedly. "Now, tell me how we're going to smash that damn motherfucker's stuck-up nose flat."

*...He still needs to work on that crude way of speaking, though,* Tang Soso sighed. 

Straightening her posture, she replied, "As I mentioned earlier, Seonwoo Jin has the backing of nearly all the clubs in the Club Union. That support won't easily waver just because you hand out some free food. Your chances of winning are less than ten percent."

"Ugh..."

"However, if you're wondering whether there's an opening, there is. Not all the clubs in the Union support Seonwoo Jin. Some dislike him, and others just don't care about the election. We need to bring all of these people to our side."

"How?"

Tang Soso's eyes glinted dangerously. "Before we get to that, let me ask you something. Do you know which club in the Union is the largest?"

Hyonwon Kang tilted his head. "Isn't it the BRS?"

The Bladesmanship Research Society, or BRS, was one of the main pillars of the current Club Union. Peng Sahyuk had once held the position of president, but after he transferred out of the Azure Dragon Academy, Seonwoo Jin, who had been serving as vice president, took his place.

Tang Soso shook her head. "Wrong. The BRS is only the second largest club in the Union."

"Then which one is the largest?"

"The Swordsmanship Research Society, or SRS for short."

In the murim, most martial artists wielded swords or blades, and the same was true for the students of the Azure Dragon Academy. Naturally, the clubs for sword and blade wielders grew into the academy's largest, and their rivalry simmered just beneath the surface.

With a peculiar smile, Tang Soso said, "To win this election, we need to bring the SRS President over to our side."

Hyonwon Kang searched through his memories for a moment, then asked, "The SRS President... I've heard of her. The Sword Flower, right?"

Tang Soso nodded. "Yes. If we can bring Senior Yoo Yiran to our side, our chances of success will immediately rise to forty percent."

The SRS President, Sword Flower Yoo Yiran, was one of the academy's top swordsmen and a rival of the Sword Dragon Dokgo Jun. Moreover, she was a beauty whose alias included the word 'flower' and a powerful figure who could influence the direction of the Club Union. Therefore, ever since Baek Suryong had mentioned the Club Union election, Tang Soso had already intended to contact the SRS.

"Why didn't someone like her run in the election?" Hyonwon Kang asked.

"That's because Senior Yoo Yiran isn't interested in anything besides the sword."

"Oh, I know someone like that too." Hyonwon Kang grinned, feeling a sense of familiarity. "So, should we go meet the Sword Flower right now?"

"Senior Yoo Yiran won't meet you if you just ask her out of the blue. Luckily, I have a personal relationship with her, so I'll arrange a meeting for tomorrow. Still, she's a bit... peculiar, so you should be prepared."

"Is there anything she likes? Maybe I should bring a gift or something."

"It's better not to bring anything. She's especially resistant to receiving gifts from men... Ah!" Suddenly recalling something, Tang Soso clapped her hands together. "When you meet her tomorrow, bring Wiji Cheon along. You might be able to win her favor."

"Wiji Cheon? Why him all of a sudden?"

With a knowing smile, Tang Soso explained, "Senior Yoo Yiran frequently talks to her sword. Doesn't Wiji Cheon do that a lot too?"
