"Damn it..." the Seventh Shroud let out an involuntary curse as he frantically used his movement arts to escape. 

He hadn't cussed like this in years. Ever since his assassin training, every word he spoke was meticulously calculated. A true assassin had to control a hundred faces and a thousand expressions. Yet, in the wake of the monster he'd rather not think about, his perfect control was slipping.

Praying that the fiend was slower than him, he glanced back.

His hopes were immediately dashed. A crimson-colored sword qi whizzed past him and sliced through a number of massive trees, causing them to topple to the side. A man with blood-red hair and eyes was hot on his trail, closing the gap with terrifying speed.

The Seventh Shroud gulped in terror. He had already lost his right arm and had just narrowly escaped losing a leg. Blood dripped from his mangled shoulder, the wounds more like a beast's bite than a sword cut. He had faced many martial arts masters, but none had wielded such brutal swordsmanship.

*No, can that even be called swordsmanship?* he thought, remembering the sword qi that had devoured his arm like a bloodthirsty dragon. The Black Death Demonic Art he was so proud of was shattered in an instant, crippling him before he even knew it.

*...This is insanity.*

Baek Suryong was not supposed to be a peak master. In fact, up until a few moments ago, the Seventh Shroud was certain that his skills and experience were superior to Baek Suryong's, but now he found himself completely outmatched. Every move of his Black Death Demonic Art was countered, every attack thwarted.

*Is it because of the Blood Demon's martial art? No, it's something more fundamental, something I can't fathom. It's impossible, I just can't grasp the nature of this monster…*

Realizing he couldn't win, the Seventh Shroud turned and fled with all his might. His seasoned assassin's skills and advanced inner arts fueled his swift escape, and though missing an arm unbalanced him, it somehow made him lighter and faster.

As he poured all his energy into fleeing, the scenery blurred around him. He had to get away.

*I must inform the First Shroud that someone has mastered the Blood Demon's martial arts. If the connection between Deathshroud and the Blood Cult is revealed…*

SPURT!

Sword qi nicked his shoulder, sending a spray of blood into the air.

"After all that boasting, *now* you're running away?" Baek Suryong taunted.

Baek Suryong was rapidly gaining ground. Gritting his teeth, the Seventh Shroud drew on all his inner energy reserves.

*I can't die like this.*

As an assassin, he'd often walked the fine line between life and death. Still, he'd never imagined such a pathetic demise as dying at the hands of a mere martial arts instructor, not even one of the Ten Supremes or a famous martial master.

"How long do you think you can run?"

The monster was almost upon him. Sword qi sliced his side open, spilling more blood. Desperate, the Seventh Shroud hurled all his hidden weapons and poisons, hoping to slow his pursuer. It was futile.

*I can't hold on any longer...*

Just then, he spotted a man dressed in the robes of a military official ahead of him, not a master, but clearly skilled.

*I'll take him hostage.*

Despite Baek Suryong's mastery of demonic arts and rough demeanor, he was fundamentally an orthodox martial artist.

*After all, he's still Orthodox... right? Ahh, I have no choice!*

The Seventh Shroud lunged forward, aiming to grab the man and use him as a shield or a hostage.

However, as he reached for the man, the stern-faced figure said, "You're an assassin. Are you the one who tried to harm the Prime Minister?"

"Ugh!!" An immense pressure pinned the Seventh Shroud to the ground, leaving him writhing like an insect.

The man, expression still neutral, drew his sword, revealing the words "Heavenly Mandate" etched on the blade. "By the mandate of heaven," he declared.

"No way..." Too late, the Seventh Shroud realized who he had attacked. The panic on his face faded into resignation. Closing his eyes, he whispered, "…It is an honor to die by your hand."

"…I will execute you," Skysword concluded.

In a flash, a line was drawn from the top of the Seventh Shroud's head to his groin. Cleaved in two, his body split apart as he fell to the ground, lifeless.

Skysword shifted his gaze from the corpse to the man who had been chasing the Seventh Shroud. "Are you an assassin too?"

Baek Suryong abruptly skidded to a halt, his hair and eyes quickly fading back to their natural colors. "No," he responded cautiously.

*This is troublesome,* he thought. Despite his intermediate mastery of the Heaven Defying Divine Art, which heightened his senses, Baek Suryong hadn't detected the man in front of him until it was too late. 

"Are you Skysword?" he asked.

"Yes."

Baek Suryong fell silent, contemplating his next move. As soon as he noticed the words "Heavenly Mandate" on the man's sword, he realized the gravity of the situation. Revealing the Heaven Defying Divine Art to one of the Ten Supremes was a severe mistake, even if Skysword was not an orthodox martial artist but a master from the Imperial Palace.

"Who are you?" Skysword pressed.

Feeling cold sweat trickle down his back, Baek Suryong resisted the urge to back down. "I am Baek Suryong, an instructor at the Azure Dragon Academy. Elder Gongson Su and I..."

"You have learned a peculiar martial art," Skysword cut him off sharply, raising his sword.

Baek Suryong instinctively stepped back to create some distance. "Did Shadow not tell you about me?"

"She did, but there's no way for me to verify if you are who you claim."

"Want to see my identity token?"

"I'm not in the mood for jokes." Skysword's expression was grave as he lowered his voice, "I will sever your arms first and question you later."

"Hey hey, I don't care much for jokes either."

Instead of replying, Skysword casually swung his sword and Baek Suryong, on high alert, instantly moved out of its intended path. The blade narrowly missed him, slicing through the air and cutting down dozens of trees before dissipating. 

Baek Suryong swallowed hard, relieved for the moment.

"Impressive," Skysword said, his lips curving into a slight smile.

"Wait! Shadow will verify my identity when she gets here."

Skysword paused for a moment, then replied, "Okay, I'll wait. After I cut off your arms, that is."

"What the fuck... Ugh!"

As Skysword began to fully channel his inner qi, an immense pressure descended on Baek Suryong, making his knees buckle. 

*As expected of one of the Ten Supremes,* Baek Suryong thought. Only a martial artist of the Ten Supremes' caliber could exert such control over aura that it paralyzed anyone less skilled.

"I want to see for myself what kind of person you are."

*Liar! You're just curious about my martial art!* Finally, Baek Suryong understood Skysword's real intention. The uniqueness of the Heaven Defying Divine Art had clearly not escaped the master's notice.

*I doubt he actually means to harm me... though he doesn't seem keen on holding back either.*

Skysword pointed his sword at Baek Suryong's left arm, saying, "Left."

It was a warning. Baek Suryong felt his anger surge but knew better than to directly confront one of the Ten Supremes. Struggling against the growing pressure, he groaned, "Shouldn't you be rescuing the Prime Minister instead of doing this? He's lying unconscious back there..."

Skysword chuckled, "It's fine. The Prime Minister's breathing is steady, and there's no one else nearby."

*…Fuck this guy, he already knows everything and is acting like that on purpose.* Baek Suryong gritted his teeth. A fight was now inevitable. 

"Crazy bastard... You're really going through with this," he complained, even as he unleashed the full power of the Heaven Defying Divine Art.

WHOOSH!

As Baek Suryong's hair turned a vivid crimson and his eyes sparked with a fierce red glow, he steadied his stance, his knees no longer trembling.

Skysword sighed, "As I thought, that's quite the dangerous martial art. What is it?"

"I have no intention of explaining it to someone as ungrateful as you," Baek Suryong replied, his voice bristling with unruly defiance.

"Are you claiming to be my benefactor?"

"How many times have I saved Elder Gongson Su from assassins? Is this how you repay someone who protected your patron? By persecuting them without any proof? Do you even know what gratitude is?"

"If your words hold truth, then I will admit my mistake. But that is a discussion for later." Skysword adjusted his sword slightly. "I will go for the left."

Baek Suryong pointed Moon Shadow at Skysword's right arm in retaliation. "Right for me."

"……" For the first time, Skysword's eyebrow twitched, and he imbued his sword with even more power. 

Golden energy swirled around him, while Baek Suryong's aura erupted in massive crimson waves.

BOOM!

The two forces clashed and coiled, forming a dragon-shaped whirlwind. Inside, the two men moved in unison.

"Stop! He is the Elder's benefactor!" a desperate cry suddenly pierced the chaos.

Using all of her speed, Shadow fearlessly plunged into the whirlwind. Numerous cuts immediately appeared on her body, but she still screamed, "Please, stop!"

The whirlwind quickly dissipated, revealing the two men standing face to face with each other. Skysword's sword was at Baek Suryong's throat, and Baek Suryong, bloodied but defiant, tightened his grip on Moon Shadow. Both still had their arms.

Shadow yelled at Skysword, "Lower your sword now! Sir!"

"...Very well." Skysword sheathed his sword and turned away. "I will see to the Prime Minister. Tend to your injuries and follow me."

Baek Suryong watched him leave, his gaze filled with unresolved anger.

Skysword, however, was already reflecting on their brief encounter. Although he had held back, the danger Baek Suryong had posed to him was real. *Sensing the threat, I subconsciously changed my target from his left arm to his neck, but that guy never wavered and went for my right arm.*

It had been a long time since Skysword had felt such intense emotions. He glanced at his right sleeve, only to see that it had started to disintegrate.

"Huh!" he unintentionally let out a gasp of admiration.
