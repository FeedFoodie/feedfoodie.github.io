"You said you'd be right back, so why are you so late? Did you get into a fight somewhere?" Mae Geuklyom frowned, scrutinizing Baek Suryong, who had finally returned after several hours. 

He'd been worried something might've happened since Baek Suryong was much later than expected, but thankfully, his grandson didn't appear injured at all. Instead, the little rascal was grinning from ear to ear.

"Sorry, I got held up at the outhouse," Baek Suryong replied slyly, his face as content as if he'd stumbled upon free money on the ground.

"Hmph, that must have been one hell of a satisfying dump," Namgung Su sneered.

Unfazed by Namgung Su's sarcasm, Baek Suryong grinned mischievously and leaned closer to the prudish man. "How did you know that? Damn, I felt like I was passing a coiled dragon. As if I had just relieved myself of ten years of accumulated constipation. Well, I suppose you must be familiar with that feeling as well. Judging by the constant scowl on your face, you're probably constipated all the time, aren't you, Mr. Namgung?"

"Ridiculous. Disgusting. Stay away from me," Namgung Su grimaced and quickly backed away, clearly unwilling to take part in this baloney.

Mae Geuklyom clicked his tongue. "You cheeky brat. Anyway, what are you grinning like that for?"

"Some good things happened," Baek Suryong admitted.

"You had a lucky encounter in the Valley of Evil, didn't you?" Mae Geuklyom guessed.

As expected, Mae Geuklyom was sharp. Noticing the change in his grandson's aura, he figured Baek Suryong must have had a lucky encounter in the Valley of Evil.

Baek Suryong nodded eagerly. "I did gain a lot in the Valley of Evil. I can't really explain it all, but..."

"No need to tell me everything," Mae Geuklyom cut in firmly. "Secrets related to one's martial arts are never easy to share, even with family. Nevertheless, don't get complacent. Only through relentless training can you reach higher levels."

"I'll keep that in mind." Baek Suryong replied respectfully.

*Grandpa's right. Once I get back to the Azure Dragon Academy, I need to sort through everything I've gained.*

aggAnnoy07

He obtained a lot this time in the Valley of Evil. From the Blood Cult's hidden underground cave, he secured the Blood Elixir and the Black Dragon Armor. On top of that, he also absorbed half of the Ice Essence left behind by the Nine Yin Witch.

*Moreover, I've formed an army to fight against the Blood Cult in the future.*

Blue Eyed Freak had agreed to his plan to rebuild the Valley of Evil. Though it was now in ruins, soon enough, outcasts with nowhere else to turn would gather there again. If Blue Eyed Freak could control and train them, they'd become a formidable force in the upcoming war against the Blood Cult.

*Once I'm back, I'll immediately send supplies through the White Dragon Conglomerate.*

Baek Suryong grinned to himself again, lost in thought.

Suddenly, Ak Yeonho approached him quietly and whispered, "Hyung-nim, the kids are behaving strangely."

"What's wrong?"

Currently, the instructors were riding on horseback while the students, still nursing their injuries, traveled in carriages. 

Ak Yeonho, who had just peeped inside one of the carriages, furrowed his brows. "I told the students to rest since they're injured, but they're all sitting cross-legged, meditating. No matter how many times I tell them to stop, they keep going. The atmosphere inside is way too intense..."

"Leave them be." Baek Suryong chuckled. "Those sheltered brats have finally seen firsthand how terrifying the murim is. They've realized how pathetic it feels to be weak."

The students had danced on the edge of death multiple times in the Valley of Evil. If luck hadn't been on their side, some or all of them might have died.

*They must have learned a lot from that.*

Baek Suryong glanced at the carriage. He was separated from the students because of the Bloody Ripper, so he didn't know what kind of battles they had fought, but looking at their wounds, he could imagine how brutal they had been. Some injuries would take a long time to heal, while others would leave lifelong scars.

"Thankfully, I heard that Hyonwon Kang's leg will heal soon. The physicians were amazed at his monstrous recovery speed," Ak Yeonho remarked, watching Baek Suryong's expression carefully. He was worried that if Hyonwon Kang ended up with a permanent limp, Baek Suryong might blame himself.

aggAnnoy17

Noticing Ak Yeonho's concern, Baek Suryong chuckled, "Of course he's healing fast. Whose student do you think he is?"

Unlike the initial chase, the journey back to Azure Dragon Academy was leisurely. Preventing the students' injuries from getting worse was the priority, so the group couldn't travel fast. As a result, the journey back would take several times longer than the journey to the Valley of Evil. However, there was someone among them who couldn't wait that long.

"Headmaster, I'll head back first. I've got a mountain of classes to teach and piles of work to handle," Namgung Su said.

Mae Geuklyom replied, "Very well. Thank you for your efforts. I'll be sure to bring the students back safely."

Namgung Su turned to Baek Suryong, his usually stoic face showing a rare hint of resignation. "You. Don't cause any more trouble and come straight back to the academy."

aggAnnoy09

"What? Who are you calling a troublemaker..."

Before Baek Suryong could finish speaking, Namgung Su spun on his heel and disappeared in an instant, moving so swiftly it seemed like he had vanished into thin air.

Grinding his teeth, Baek Suryong muttered under his breath, "That guy..."

"Hahahaha!" The students watching the scene from the carriage windows burst out laughing.

"Ahem!" Mae Geuklyom cleared his throat, breaking the lighthearted mood. "Although it took us three days to get here, the journey back will take about fifteen. While you're recovering, take care not to aggravate your internal injuries or reopen your wounds."

aggAnnoy12

"With the extra time, why don't we help the students with their martial arts? They seem eager to learn," Baek Suryong suggested.

Mae Geuklyom nodded. "That's a good idea. Their eyes definitely look more resolute now."

Thus, the three instructors took turns teaching the five students.

Wiji Cheon meditated while hugging the Soul Sword. Whenever he had questions about swordsmanship, he would get up and approach Baek Suryong or Mae Geuklyom.

Hyonwon Kang, who was the most severely injured, sat silently and reflected on the battles in the Valley of Evil. Occasionally, he would ask Baek Suryong for advice on the Asura Blood Heaven Blade, but his expression was so grim that the instructors were hesitant to take the initiative.

Ya Suhyeok was the first to recover fully. As such, Mae Geuklyom, Baek Suryong, and Ak Yeonho took turns sparring with him. Through these sessions, Ya Suhyeok constantly pondered how to effectively use the Eighteen Strikes of the Viridian Forest in real combat.

Lastly, driven by the dedication of his juniors, Geo Sangwoong, as the only uninjured one, took every chance when the carriage stopped to train diligently.

*They're all martial arts geniuses. They know how to improve on their own,* Baek Suryong marveled.

Yet, while the others were reflecting and honing their skills, Yeo Min remained lying in bed.

*I should talk to her soon,* Baek Suryong thought, waiting for the right moment.

{sep}

The next day, after they stopped by a village and settled into an inn, Baek Suryong made his way to Yeo Min's room.

"How are you feeling?" he asked gently.

"I'm okay..." Yeo Min nodded, her face still pale. She had regained enough strength to move, but her spirit hadn't recovered. Ever since the Nine Yin Witch attacked her, she had been in a daze.

aggAnnoy07

Baek Suryong sipped his tea quietly for a moment, then said, "About the yin energy residing in your body..."

"...It came from the Nine Yin Witch, didn't it?" Yeo Min cut in.

"So, you knew."

Yeo Min nodded weakly. As soon as she regained consciousness, she had felt a powerful yet incredibly pure and clear yin energy inside her qi center. It hadn't taken her long to figure out where it came from.

"The Nine Yin Witch is... dead, right?" she asked hesitantly.

"Yes. She came to her senses at the very end and asked me to tell you that she's sorry," Baek Suryong confirmed.

"......" Yeo Min fell silent.

Baek Suryong set up a qi sound barrier to ensure their conversation remained private.

"Yeo Min, please don't share what I'm about to tell you with anyone else. It might attract unwanted attention from malicious forces," he said, before telling her the story of the Nine Yin Witch.

aggAnnoy05

As she listened, Yeo Min's expression changed several times. By the time Baek Suryong finished speaking, she let out a long sigh, "I see..."

"At least, in the end, she seemed to be at peace," Baek Suryong comforted.

"......" For a while, Yeo Min said nothing, lost in her thoughts.

Suddenly, she mumbled, "...I needed money for medicine."

"Hmm?"

"The reason I was so desperate to make money," Yeo Min explained, fiddling with her now-white hair. "I've been taking medicine to suppress the yin energy inside me for a long time. The ingredients are really expensive."

"You don't need to take that medicine anymore. In fact, taking it now would be dangerous," Baek Suryong said firmly. The yin energy in Yeo Min's body was now on a completely different level. If she tried to suppress it with medicine now, the rebound would likely kill her. "From now on, you need to learn ice arts to control the yin energy in your body."

"...My mother told me that if I learned ice arts, my lifespan would be shortened, like hers was. She warned me never to learn it," Yeo Min whispered, her fear evident in her eyes.

"That's only if you learned the wrong kind." Baek Suryong smiled gently, extending a finger toward the teacup in front of him.

CRACKLE...

A thin layer of ice formed over the tea, freezing it. Even though he was only at the beginner level, it was unmistakably the White Ice Divine Art, the greatest ice art in the world.

"If you master the martial arts I show you, you'll be fine. With your natural constitution and the Ice Essence, you'll improve faster than anyone else," he added.

"T-That..." Stunned speechless, Yeo Min's eyes widened in shock. 

aggAnnoy06

Finally, when she came back to her senses, she stammered, "M-Mr. Baek, you don't need to give me money anymore."

"Of course not. Were you planning to keep accepting it shamelessly?" Baek Suryong teased.

Yeo Min had been staying and eating at the White Dragon Manor while receiving a monthly salary from Baek Suryong in exchange for participating in the movement arts tournament at the Heavenly Martial Festival. Although she needed the money for her medicine, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was different from the other students. In essence, her relationship with Baek Suryong was a financial transaction, nothing more.

However, that dynamic had just changed.

Embarrassed, Yeo Min pouted. "Tsk, you could keep giving me an allowance... Just think of it as pocket money for your cute student."

"You cheeky brat." Baek Suryong reached out and lightly flicked her forehead.

"Ow! How could you hit an injured patient?!" Yeo Min protested, but her expression was much brighter than before.

*What a strong-willed kid,* Baek Suryong thought with a grin. Yeo Min lost her mother at a young age and was betrayed by the Nine Yin Witch, someone she'd opened her heart to. Even though she received the Ice Essence and a chance to learn the White Ice Divine Art, she must have been deeply hurt emotionally.

*I was worried she might succumb to her inner demons, but it seems my worried were unfounded. Despite her delicate appearance, doesn't she have more grit than the boys?*

Baek Suryong chuckled to himself, "Looks like I have good luck with students in this life."

"Pardon? What did you say?" Yeo Min asked, confused, but her teacher refused to repeat himself.

That day, Baek Suryong found the successor to the White Ice Divine Art, and the final disciple for his four masters.

{sep}

Fifteen days later, the group arrived in Nanchang, where the Azure Dragon Academy was located.

aggAnnoy14

Before entering the city, Mae Geuklyom cast a worried glance at Baek Suryong. "Get ready to face the consequences of your actions."

Baek Suryong nodded calmly. Although he had gained much in the Valley of Evil, the fact that Wiji Cheon had been kidnapped by the White-Haired Demon was clearly his fault, and he had no intention of shirking his responsibility.

*Anything's fine as long as I'm not fired,* he thought.

He was willing to accept things like a massive pay cut. The real problem was if he couldn't continue to teach his classes. That would severely disrupt his plans to win the Heavenly Martial Festival.

*I'll do whatever it takes to keep teaching Defense Against the Unorthodox Arts. Even if it's shady...*

Steeling himself, Baek Suryong stepped through the gates...

"Whoa!" A tremendous cheer rose from the crowd gathered at the city entrance, as though they had been waiting for them.

"Are they enemies?"

"What's going on?"

Startled, the group drew their weapons, ready to fight. However, they were instead met with an unexpected welcome.

"The heroes of the Azure Dragon Academy have returned!"

"The prodigies who defeated the villains of the Valley of Evil!"

"It's the Azure Dragon Hero and his students!"

In the face of such an overwhelmingly warm reception, everyone's jaws dropped in confusion.
