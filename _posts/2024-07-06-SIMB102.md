CRASH!

The wine bottle smashed to pieces on impact with Pung Jinho's head.

"Ugh!" Pung Jinho cried out as he fell backward, his forehead sliced open and bleeding profusely.

Baek Suryong rose to his feet and approached the older teacher, clutching another bottle. "Hey, how many girls have you tried to seduce?"

"You crazy bastard...!"

Pung Jinho tried to rise and strike back, but Baek Suryong was quicker, smashing the second bottle into his nose. As Pung Jinho reeled from the pain, Baek Suryong's next kick sent him slamming into the wall.

BOOM!

With a loud thud, Pung Jinho hit the wall and crumpled to the ground, screaming, "AHHH!"

Baek Suryong immediately sat on top of him and unleashed a flurry of blows.

POW! BASH! THWACK!

"Ugh! What?! Why…?"

"Do you really not know, you sex-obsessed scumbag?"

Curled up into a ball and shielding his face with his arms, Pung Jinho tried to gather his qi and defend himself. Unfortunately, Baek Suryong gave him no chance to retaliate, hitting him relentlessly with anything he could grab - bottles, bowls, plates, cups. Finally, when he ran out of things to break, he pummeled Pung Jinho with his bare fists.

"You pathetic piece of shit, who do you think you are?" Baek Suryong roared, his face twisting into a savage grin as he radiated killing intent. For the first time since he was reincarnated, he was truly livid.

Pinned to the floor, Pung Jinho didn't dare to fight back. All he could do was mumble through clenched teeth, "Do you have any idea...just who you're up against?"

"Huuuh? You still haven't had enough?"

Drenched in alcohol, food, and blood, Pung Jinho was a sorry sight, his once-neat hair disheveled and his proud beard in shambles. This was no fight between murim masters, it was a run of the mill tavern brawl.

aggAnnoy11

"Hyung-nim! Stop!" Myeong Il'oh yelled, grabbing Baek Suryong by the waist.

Baek Suryong could have easily shrugged him off and continued, but he paused, his anger subsiding a bit. "Phew... consider yourself lucky," he warned Pung Jinho, brushing off his hands.

Looking as if he'd seen a ghost, Myeong Il'oh demanded, "Hyung-nim, what the hell are you doing?"

"You heard what that son of a bitch said."

"But you can't just beat up someone like this! Did you even think about how we are going to deal with the consequences?"

aggAnnoy10

"Ugh..." At that moment, Pung Jinho, regaining his senses, struggled to his feet and leaned against the wall. "What kind of lunatic...?"

"A lunatic? Haven't had enough yet?"

Baek Suryong raised his fist, making Pung Jinho flinch. An instant later, however, Pung Jinho felt a rush of shame at his cowardice. He focused his qi, reminding himself, *it wasn't a fair fight, I didn't lose in a true martial arts duel.*

"You coward, ambushing me like a back-alley thug!" he snarled.

"Haha, what?" Baek Suryong laughed at the absurd excuse. His voice, devoid of any pretense, was as cold as a blade as he suggested, "How about we step outside and settle this properly then? Put that thing on your shoulders at stake?"

*I must not fall for his childish provocation!* Pung Jinho thought, suppressing the urge to retort. Trying his best to sound calm and mature, he said, "Baek Suryong, do you think you can act like this because of your grandfather?"

It was now widely known that the Headmaster, Sword Addict Mae Geuklyom, revered master of martial arts, nightmare to all naughty students and respected teacher to many graduates, was Baek Suryong's grandfather.

"What does my grandfather have to do with this?" Baek Suryong snapped.

*Does he really think I don't know he's only daring to act out because of his relationship with Mae Geuklyom? No new teacher would pull such a stunt without someone to back them up.* Pung Jinho sneered, "Why do you think Mae Geuklyom is still just the Headmaster despite his skills and experience? Do you think he's just waiting for the right time? Not a chance."

"Hmm... Why is that?" Baek Suryong asked innocently, deciding to listen quietly for now. Pung Jinho seemed to have misunderstood him, but curious about Mae Geuklyom's continued status as headmaster, he didn't feel compelled to correct the man yet.

aggAnnoy09

"Because of his rigid and strict personality, Mae Geuklyom doesn't get along with people and has no close friends."

Disinterested in academy politics and authority, Mae Geuklyom had dedicated his life to the sword and the education of students. As a result, though, none of the instructors felt the need to get close to him, leaving him socially isolated.

"To put it simply, you've placed your trust in the wrong man." Pung Jinho's swollen face twisted into a grimace. "Mae Geuklyom is a person who skipped his own daughter, your mother's funeral out of pride. Do you really think he'd treat you any differently...?"

Drawing his sword and aiming it at Pung Jinho's forehead, Baek Suryong's expression turned steely. His aura surged, causing his blue robe to billow as if caught in a gust of wind, while objects nearby began to quiver. "You want to die? Then go ahead. Insult my grandfather again," he threatened.

"You... if you harm me..."

aggAnnoy20

Baek Suryong took a step forward. "Something terrible will happen. Yadda yadda yadda."

Pung Jinho shuddered involuntarily. Baek Suryong's murderous intent was palpable, sowing the fear of death in his heart.

"Whatever happens to me, you will be dead by then, and it will no longer matter to you, will it?" Baek Suryong chuckled.

"Ugh..." Pung Jinho's mind raced. Just a few moments ago, he had believed that he could win a fair fight, but now his legs were shaking uncontrollably.

Ultimately, his legs gave out and he collapsed to the ground.

Baek Suryong stood over him, a smirk playing on his lips. "You're not worth keeping alive."

"W-Wait..."

Baek Suryong advanced, sword raised, when Myeong Il'oh suddenly stood in front of him, a stern expression on his face.

aggAnnoy06

"Hyung-nim, that's enough. Please stop."

"Move."

"If you murder an instructor, the academy will be thrown into chaos, and never mind being fired, you'll be branded a criminal."

"......"

"I know you're angry, but could you please stop for my sake? I don't want to be punished too."

aggAnnoy12

Baek Suryong looked at Myeong Il'oh for a while, then sighed and put away his sword. "I'm sorry, I didn't think about that," he apologized.

Ending Pung Jinho's miserable life was simple, but a piece of trash wasn't worth sacrificing their careers for.

"Huff... huff..." Relieved to be alive, Pung Jinho gasped, his face looking like he had aged ten years from the ordeal.

Baek Suryong looked back at him and spat, "Let me tell you something. I was never interested in your proposal to begin with."

"...Why?"

"Your premise was wrong. The Azure Dragon Academy will not collapse due to insufficient funding. In fact, its budget will double next year."

"H-How?"

Pung Jinho didn't know that Baek Suryong had managed to get the Prime Minister, Gongson Su, to sponsor the school. It seemed that the true identity of the old examinee had been kept secret from everyone except the few teachers who attended the meeting, Noh Goonsang, Kwak Cheolwoo, and Namgoong Su.

aggAnnoy01

"You also said the academy won't be invited to the Heavenly Martial Festival next year? That's not happening."

"...Why?" Pung Jinho looked up blankly.

With a confident grin, Baek Suryong declared mockingly, "Because the Azure Dragon Academy will win this year. If they fail to invite us next year, we'll stay the eternal champions."

"Ha, ha ha..." Pung Jinho, in his disheveled state, laughed bitterly. "You're not just confident, you're arrogantly oblivious."

"Better that than a pathetic man consumed by his inferiority complex."

"...Fine." Pung Jinho staggered to his feet, his gaze empty yet malicious. *Even if he's only holding back for that guy's sake, at least he has no intention of killing me right now,* he thought, glancing at Myeong Il'oh and steadying himself.

He faced Baek Suryong once more, his eyes brimming with malice and a slight, derisive smile on his pale face. "You... now I see that you're quite the master. So that's why you're so confident. But here's the thing... Even weak men have their own ways. I'm going to use every means I have to destroy you in this industry. What do you think? Will you kill me right now?"

However, Baek Suryong simply scoffed, unaffected. "Do your worst."

"...We'll see." Pung Jinho straightened his clothes, cleaned his beard, and exited the room. His face was ghostly white, but no one stopped him.

He had nearly reached the brothel's main gate when Baek Suryong suddenly appeared, blocking his path.

"Wait a moment," Baek Suryong said.

"...What now? Are you picking a fight again?"

"You need to pay for the drinks before you go."

aggAnnoy12

"......"

"…And the broken bottles and dishes too." Baek Suryong turned his pockets inside out, showing they were empty. "We're just temporary instructors, so we don't earn much."

Pung Jinho's face flushed with rage, but he eventually pulled out his wallet and threw it at Baek Suryong. "Here, use this to settle the bill."

After paying, Pung Jinho turned to Baek Suryong just before leaving. "Mr. Baek, may I give you some advice?"

"By all means." Seeing the amount of money, Baek Suryong replied with a satisfied smile.

"The class you're teaching."

"...?"

aggAnnoy05

"Classes with insufficient enrollment are canceled."

"......"

"Just a friendly warning. Be careful."

With a meaningful grin, Pung Jinho left the brothel.

The smile disappeared from Baek Suryong's face.

The next morning, a new class was added to the academy's bulletin board.

- Defense Against the Unorthodox Arts - Baek Suryong
- Analysis of Unorthodox Sect Martial Arts - Pung Jinho

Both courses bore almost identical names and were set for the same day and time. A crowd of students quickly formed around the board, their excitement almost tangible.

"Wow, a new class by Mr. Pung?"

"Yeah, I wanted to sign up for it..."

"But it's at the same time as Mr. Baek's class."

"If you have to pick one, Mr. Pung's class is the way to go."

"But isn't it just an elective?"

"Don't you know? If you cross Mr. Pung..."

It was obvious: if forced to choose, they would all opt for Pung Jinho's class.

Myeong Il'oh, who had spent the previous evening with Baek Suryong, gave him a grave look and said, "Hyung-nim, this..."

"So this is how he wants to play?" Baek Suryong stared at the bulletin board, his lips curling into a brazen grin. "Damn, this will be *fun*."
