After the duel ended, Gongson Su and Dokgo Jun stepped off the platform, sharing jokes and lighthearted banter.

"Please forgive my ignorance and rudeness earlier."

"Haha, it's alright."

"......" Dokgo Jun glanced at Gongson Su with respect and a twinge of guilt. Initially, he had brushed off Gongson Su's application as nothing more than a wealthy man's pastime. After facing him directly though, Dokgo Jun recognized the sheer effort the elder had put in. Just the calluses on his hands spoke volumes of the pain he had endured.

Grinning sheepishly, Dokgo Jun quipped, "…If you pass, you should address me as your senior properly."

His joke might not have been the funniest, but Gongson Su laughed heartily, "Haha! Alright. If I make it into the Azure Dragon Academy, I'll call you Senior Dokgo."

*Doesn't his expression seem slightly bitter?* Dokgo Jun wondered, but quickly wrote it off as fatigue. "You should see a physician for your injuries. They're not serious, but it's best to treat them quickly," he advised concernedly.

"What about you?"

"I'm fine. I still have more duels ahead."

While Gongson Su's palms were torn and his clothes disheveled, Dokgo Jun's clothes were pristine and he hadn't broken a sweat.

Gongson Su chuckled awkwardly, "I worried for nothing."

"The clinic is that way. I must prepare for my next duel… so I'll see you later."

"Wait!" Gongson Su stopped Dokgo Jun, who was about to walk away. "…It might just be an old man's meddling, but may I offer you some advice?"

"Of course." Dokgo Jun turned back, standing at attention, ready to listen.

Gongson Su smiled, impressed by how well-mannered the Student Council President was. "I'm not an expert in martial arts, but your talent is evident."

"......"

"With your talent, excellent upbringing, and hard work, it's no surprise you've achieved so much so young."

"You're too kind." Dokgo Jun bowed his head, touched by the praise. In the Dokgo Clan, he was celebrated as the greatest prodigy in a century. Raised amidst lofty expectations and rigorous training, his dedication had led him to surpass even his older brothers in mastering the Nine Swords of Dokgo.

"You've probably heard you're a prodigy many times," Gongson Su noted. He knew the weight of such words, for he himself was a prodigy who had passed the highest imperial examinations at a young age.

"So… don't despair," he added gently.

aggAnnoy20

"Pardon?"

"As you live, you'll meet others whose talents surpass yours. Don't despair in their presence. There's no need to feel inferior. Life is long."

Dokgo Jun furrowed his brows in confusion. "I've already met many who are more talented than me," he admitted hesitantly.

Gongson Su smiled warmly. "I was just being cautious. Don't take it to heart."

"No, I'll see it as a reminder to train even harder."

"Haha, I've taken too much of your time. I should go see the physician now."

With those words, they went their separate ways.

Several minutes later, Dokgo Jun fully grasped the true meaning of Gongson Su's words.

"Candidate Wiji Cheon! Step forward!"

By sheer coincidence, Wiji Cheon's opponent was Dokgo Jun. Nervously, Wiji Cheon bowed slightly and said, "Please take care of me."

aggAnnoy10

"Show me your full strength."

"Yes!" Wiji Cheon replied brightly, drawing his sword.

"......" Dokgo Jun felt a wave of dizziness come over him, as if his diligent training had somehow betrayed him. He knew that Wiji Cheon was formidable, but only direct confrontation could reveal the true extent of the boy's strength. 

And facing him now, it seemed almost cruelly unfair.

*How could someone so young be like that...*

There appeared to be no openings, or at least, Dokgo Jun couldn't spot any at his level. Rather than a junior, he felt like he was up against one of the many extraordinary talents his age, many of whom attended the Heavenly Martial Academy.

"Senior? Are you alright? Can we begin?"

"…Ah."

aggAnnoy14

Wiji Cheon's question brought Dokgo Jun back to reality. He clenched his teeth, the taste of blood sharpening his focus. "…Don't hold back," he mumbled.

"Excuse me?"

"Give it your all."

"…Are you sure?"

Dokgo Jun tightened his grip on his sword. Could he lose this duel? Possibly. But he couldn't afford to. As the Student Council President and the top prodigy of the Azure Dragon Academy, losing was not an option, no matter how talented the opponent.

aggAnnoy19

Assuming his battle stance, Dokgo Jun declared, "Come. Or rather, I'll come to you."

He leaped forward, closing the gap instantly. For the first time, he unleashed his full power, dismissing any concerns for Wiji Cheon's well-being. With a singular focus, he aimed to end the duel with a swift, powerful strike, his formidable sword slicing through the air towards Wiji Cheon. Wiji Cheon, not taking the threat lightly, countered with his own blade.

As their swords collided, a massive burst of energy erupted, muting all other sounds around them.

"Unbelievable..." Ak Yeonho gasped, his eyes wide as he watched the two boys clash.

Around him, everyone shared the same sentiment, mouths agape in wonder.

aggAnnoy14

"Wow..."

"What is this..."

Even competitors on other stages paused their own fights to witness the spectacle. The judges were no different, fixated on Dokgo Jun and Wiji Cheon as their blades sparked with each collision. Soon, the duel stage bore the scars of numerous sword strikes.

"Hoo..."

"Haa..."

Catching their breath, the boys retreated briefly only to charge back into the fray.

"Take this!"

"Hah!"

To an untrained eye, they seemed perfectly matched, yet experts could spot the fundamental differences in their styles. 

Dokgo Jun wielded his sword with a firm, uncompromising grip, each strike packed with the power to overwhelm his opponent while relying on his years of relentless training to execute each technique at will. In contrast, Wiji Cheon's approach was fluid, his movements adaptive, always shifting in response to his opponent's actions.

Ak Yeonho admired Wiji Cheon's graceful swordplay, but couldn't easily say if it surpassed Dokgo Jun's. Their paths in swordsmanship diverged too widely for a simple comparison.

"Dokgo Jun is quite something," Baek Suryong remarked, the one person at the Azure Dragon Academy seemingly unconcerned by the display.

"…You call that just 'quite something'?" Ak Yeonho retorted sharply.

"Hyung-nim, aren't you moved by this duel between prodigies?"

"Prodigies? Dokgo Jun is a hard worker, not a born prodigy. Though, if effort alone makes one a prodigy, then I guess he'd qualify," Baek Suryong observed coldly. Though he recognized Dokgo Jun's skill, he was less impressed by his natural talent.

*Though praised for his talent now, Dokgo Jun will soon encounter his limits. If only his innate talent were slightly better,* he thought regretfully. A true prodigy was a rare gem among martial artists, requiring both nature and nurture.

"Cheon is the real prodigy," he stated firmly, being painfully familiar with Wiji Cheon's potential.

In battle, the usually reserved boy transformed into someone else completely, his face alight with joy as he traded blows with Dokgo Jun.

*He's truly incorrigible.*

Wiji Cheon was clearly reveling in the challenge, while Dokgo Jun appeared tense and wary, despite his slight advantage.

aggAnnoy09

"…Who do you think will win, Hyung-nim?"

"Today, it might be Dokgo Jun."

*But not next time. More importantly… why haven't the assassins made their move?* Baek Suryong scanned the area with a detached look, alert for any signs of danger. Gongson Su was engrossed in Wiji Cheon's duel, oblivious to the threat, and Shadow lurked nearby, stealthily ensuring his safety.

*They'll strike soon, I'm certain of it.*

"Yeonho, stay alert," he commanded.

"Yes? Oh, yes."

He issued a telepathic warning to the others as well, urging them to keep watch. Meanwhile, the duel between Wiji Cheon and Dokgo Jun was reaching its climax.

"Hoo… Hoo..."

"Haa… Haa..."

Both boys panted heavily, their martial arts uniforms shredded and bodies marked with superficial wounds.

"Are you tired?"

"Not... yet!"

Eyeing Wiji Cheon's determined gaze, Dokgo Jun suggested, "We should wrap this up before it drags on. Shall we go all out with our best techniques?"

"…Yeah!"

aggAnnoy20

Energy surged around them as they began to channel their strength, and soon, their swords radiated with sword qi.

"Look, sword qi!"

"Unbelievable! At such a young age..."

"The Azure Dragon Academy is going to make history this year!"

The crowd erupted at the sight of the sword qi, and even seasoned masters from orthodox sects were taken aback, constantly clearing their throats. Still, not everyone was thrilled, among them the Vice Principal.

Looking worried, Kwak Cheolwoo said, "Shouldn't we stop them? If something goes wrong..."

Noh Goonsang and Namgung Jaehak both shook their heads, eager to see more of the young swordsmen's skills.

"Let's watch a bit longer."

"I'll step in if it gets too risky."

"…Alright," Kwak Cheolwoo conceded, sighing heavily.

As the two boys pointed their qi-charged swords at each other, tension spiked among the onlookers, and Baek Suryong's anxiety mounted as well.

*If the assassins are going to strike, it'll be now. With all eyes glued to Wiji Cheon and Dokgo Jun, it's the ideal moment for an attack.*

aggAnnoy20

[Stay vigilant for any assassin activity,] he telepathically cautioned his friends.

His prediction was on point. However, the adversaries proved more audacious than he anticipated.

"Murder!"

"Aaaah!"

"Run!"

"Assassins from the unorthodox sects!"

"What's happening?!"

Screams suddenly pierced the air as blood spurted from several zones in the spectator stands. As people jostled and tripped over one another to escape, panic ensued.

"Everyone, calm down!"

The instructors struggled to maintain order, but it was a losing battle. The crowd was too large, and many were civilians, not trained warriors. The chaos quickly escalated.

"Wait a moment!"

"Everyone! Please calm down..."

Even the temporary instructors helping Baek Suryong quickly found themselves overwhelmed by the pandemonium, the crush of the crowd hampering their actions.

"Protect the Elder!" Baek Suryong yelled, but by then, dozens of assassins were already converging on Gongson Su.
