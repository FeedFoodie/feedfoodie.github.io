Three students stood behind Namgung Su: two boys and a girl, all roughly the same age as Wiji Cheon. Judging by their steady breathing and good posture, they seemed to have a solid foundation, typical of those who have trained in martial arts since they could walk.

"Master, who is Wiji Cheon?" The boy in the middle asked Namgung Su.

He bore such a resemblance to Namgung Su that I couldn't help but wonder if he was a miniature clone of the man. *Could he be Namgung Su's son?*

The boy shook his head, mumbling, "Wiji Cheon... I thought I had memorized the names of all the prodigies I should pay attention to among this year's examinees, but I don't remember that name..."

Namgung Su patted the boy on the shoulder and smiled sheepishly. "I don't know who he is either, but there's no point finding out more. Even a hedgehog favors its own children, so it's only fair that Mr. Baek should be free to think that the students he teaches are brilliant."

"Ohh, I get it."

I was appalled. *What the fuck? How are these two so adept at "comforting" me?* 

Mae Geuklyom, who seemed to share my confusion, changed the subject with a slight frown. "Mr. Namgung, why don't you introduce me to the kids behind you? Since they're going to be freshmen this year, it wouldn't hurt for me to get to know them beforehand."

The boy resembling Namgung Su stepped forward and greeted Mae Geuklyom with clasped hands. It was a respectful gesture, indicating that he was from a prestigious family. "Greetings, sir. My name is Namgung Seok. I am honored to meet the legendary Sword Addict."

"...There's no need to be overly polite. Are you of the Namgung Clan?"

"Yes. My father..." 

Namgung Seok launched into a lengthy explanation, tracing his lineage from his father to his great uncle twice removed, all of whom seemed to express the deepest respect for the Sword Addict.

*Sigh... Why are orthodox sect people always so long-winded?*

Looking slightly annoyed, Mae Geuklyom raised a hand to halt Namgung Seok's rambling. "Enough, that's too much information for me to remember."

"...My apologies, sir." Namgung Seok bowed his head, then quickly stole a glance at me. Unlike when he faced Mae Geuklyom, his eyes were cold and the corners of his mouth slightly upturned in a subtle smirk.

*Wow, he's already such a cheeky punk?* I shot Namgung Seok a threatening look. 

His expression changed instantly as he offered me a conciliatory greeting as well. "Please forgive this foolish newcomer for not knowing your great name and title."

"......" Though outwardly polite, I sensed a subtle undercurrent of disregard and mockery from him. *Sneaky little bastard.*

With a smirk, I introduced myself, "I am Baek Suryong."

"Baek Suryong..." Namgung Seok muttered, still puzzled. My anonymity was unsurprising; I was neither a renowned murim master nor a scion of a prestigious clan.

"Baek Suryong? Ah, that braggart!" The skinny boy on Namgung Su's left giggled, covering his mouth. He was slightly taller than Namgung Seok, and had the fiercest eyes of the three.

"Watch your mouth, Cho Maksaeng. There's a chance he could be our teacher this year," the girl to Namgung Su's right scolded the boy.

*How on earth did Namgung Su get such a normal student…?*

"…Well, he'll probably be gone after three months though," the girl added, snorting.

*Never mind, scratch that. They're all mini clones of Namgung Su.*

"Kukuku, aren't you being a little too harsh on Mr. Baek, Jinjin? Look at his stern expression."

"Shut up. I told you not to call me by that name, it's disgusting."

"Why the fuss? It's not like I'm interested in you."

"What did you just say..."

"Stop it, both of you," Namgung Seok interrupted.

""......"" The bickering ceased immediately, highlighting the Namgung boy's authority.

Namgung Seok then bowed to me and apologized, "Please forgive them. Come on, you guys, apologize!"

"I'm sorry."

"Sorry..."

All their heads were bowed, but their cocky eyes and bad attitudes remained unchanged.

*Whoever taught them did a thorough job. It's obvious that they think of me as a nobody who will be fired in three months. Oh wait, their teacher is Namgung Su. No wonder.*

Namgung Su stepped forward, looking like he had thoroughly enjoyed my little exchange with the kids. "I hope you don't take what they said to heart, Mr. Baek, they're just children. I will make sure to punish them when we return."

"Haha, of course I won't. I trust in your *impressive* methods for character education, Mr. Namgung," I replied, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

In truth, I really wanted to smack him, but thanks to the intervention of Noh Goonsang, the Principal of the Azure Dragon Academy, the two of us had to hide our animosity towards each other and maintain the appearance of getting along, leaving us only the option of playing word games with each other.

Mae Geuklyom sighed, "Do you two really have to be like this?"

*Dear Grandpa, I'd love to call it quits, but that bastard doesn't want to budge.*

Namgung Su fixed me with a frosty glare. "I heard you had Hyonwon Kang move out of the dormitory recently."

"He's got potential, so I'm considering mentoring him."

"He is indeed talented," Namgung Su conceded, his tone laced with mockery. "But he's lazy and weak-willed by nature. For three years, he's done nothing but lament his fate."

"So you suggested he drop out and threatened to prevent him from graduating?"

Namgung Su nodded. "I took into consideration the fact that he also tarnished the academy's reputation multiple times without a hint of remorse."

"…Hey, why did you suddenly bring his name up? Are you that upset that he rejected your offer? Do you bear a grudge against him?" 

Not long ago, Hyonwon Kang told me what had happened between him and Namgung Su on that rainy day.

> "I'll give you one last chance to turn your life around. Take my hand and join my class starting tomorrow."
>
> "I don't need it, you hypocrite."

Namgung Su had extended a hand to Hyonwon Kang, but the punk chose to shrug it off. That rejection must have wounded Namgung Su's pride.

"No, this isn't personal. I simply believe it's best for him to leave the academy without further delay, and I stand by that decision even now," Namgung Su clarified.

"You're not at all upset?"

Namgung Su snorted, his gaze unwavering. "Of course not. If anything, I'm disappointed he chose you over me."

I smirked. "Well, he couldn't have found a better mentor. If you haven't noticed, he has quite a good eye for people."

"He found a mentor suited to his capabilities. They call that birds of a feather," Namgung Su retorted.

"Is that so? Then I guess your students…"

"ENOUGH! Will you two cease this incessant bickering?" Mae Geuklyom yelled.

We immediately shut our mouths, but instead locked gazes in a silent battle of wills.

In the end, Namgung Su was the first to turn away. However, he couldn't help but squeeze in the last line, "Hyonwon Kang is a failure. Do you really think you can win the Heavenly Martial Festival with a guy like that? We'll see how many days you last. Let's go, kids."

"Yes, Master!"

Namgung Su walked away, seeming to believe he had said his piece.

Unfortunately, I wasn't quite finished with him.

"Namgung Su, do you want to make a bet with me?" I called out.

"...A bet?" Namgung Su sneered. "You seem to enjoy bets, Mr. Baek, even though you can't afford to lose."

"Don't hide behind lame excuses. If you're scared of losing, just admit it."

"...I'll at least listen to your proposal. What do you want to bet on?"

"Baek Suryong!!!" Mae Geuklyom's shout rang out from beside me, but I ignored him.

*Hyonwon Kang is a failure? No one talks about my student like that. I'm the only one allowed to insult Hyonwon Kang.*

"Shall we bet on whether your student or my student will do better on this year's entrance exam?"

"…Pfft!" Namgung Su burst into laughter. 

"What nonsense..."

"Puhahaha!"

"Kahaha..."

His students joined him.

Namgung Su looked at me incredulously. "You can't call something with impossible odds a bet."

"If you're afraid, admit it."

Namgung Su smirked. "Let's say I accept. What are the stakes?"

"If I win, I'll substitute for one of your classes this semester."

His expression turned stern. "How dare you... And if I win?"

"I haven't thought about it, but if you have a wish, say it."

Namgung Su smiled slyly. "If I win… you'll clean my room every morning and night."

"......" *This motherfucker sure knows exactly what to say to piss me off to the max!* I clenched my teeth and replied, "Fine. You sure that's what you want?"

"Just don't go back on your word when you lose."

"That's my line. Still, to make sure that doesn't happen, we need a witness..."

We turned to Mae Geuklyom.

"Mr. Headmaster..."

"Mr. Mae..."

Mae Geuklyom's expression changed from anger to resignation. "And you call yourselves *adults*... Whatever, have it your way."

With the bet settled, we parted ways.

The Azure Dragon Academy entrance exam was one month away.

I was determined to flatten Namgung Su's stuck up nose.
