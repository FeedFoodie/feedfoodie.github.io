Noh Goonsang stared blankly at the withdrawal letter Gongson Su handed him. "Quitting right after enrolling... This is a first."

"Hoho, it seems I'm setting multiple records at the Azure Dragon Academy," Gongson Su chuckled.

*There's a bitterness hidden in that laughter,* Noh Goonsang sensed. "Won't you regret it?" he asked softly.

"I will. A lot," Gongson Su admitted, his gaze lingering on the Azure Dragon emblem next to the withdrawal letter. Since he was dropping out, he had to return the emblem he had worked so hard to earn.

"However, I cannot shamelessly continue my martial arts training while watching the country rot because of corrupt officials," he continued. 

In his absence, power-hungry officials in the palace had curbed the Emperor and greedily grasped for power. Despite the Emperor's wisdom and benevolence, his lack of experience with these seasoned power players left Gongson Su no choice but to return to the palace.

"Still, I wish to support the Azure Dragon Academy from afar," he suddenly offered.

Noh Goonsang's eyes widened. "Support? What do you mean?"

From what Gongson Su had seen, the Azure Dragon Academy was a treasure trove of hidden talents. Unfortunately, the Academy's lack of notable success in the Heavenly Martial Festival over the past decade had led to a decrease in student confidence and financial support, creating a vicious cycle that pushed the Academy further into decline.

Gongson Su planned to break that cycle. 

"Principal, from this year onwards, you don't need to worry about financial issues," he affirmed.

"Hoho..." Noh Goonsang was stunned by this unexpected fortune. With just a few words, Gongson Su had ensured that financial support for the Azure Dragon Academy would surpass even that of the other Five Great Academies. "I don't know how to thank you enough."

"This is the least I can do. I hope my fellow classmates will continue to take pride in being students of the Azure Dragon Academy."

"......" After staring at Gongson Su for a moment, Noh Goonsang suddenly tore up the withdrawal letter.

"W-What are you doing...?"

"Freshman Gongson Su," Noh Goonsang said in a serious tone. "I will process this letter as a request for a deferment, not a withdrawal."

"What?"

Noh Goonsang pushed the Azure Dragon Emblem back towards Gongson Su. "When you're done with your duties at the palace, you can resume your studies anytime you want."

"......"

aggAnnoy11

"Of course, you will have to take a simple retest. I won't accept you back if you neglect your training."

"Hohoho..." Gongson Su chuckled bitterly. He was already sixty-five. In five years, he'd be seventy, and in ten years, seventy-five. 

*Resuming my studies? Can I wrap things up at the palace in five years? There are no guarantees. But whether it's five years or ten, does it matter?*

Gongson Su found himself smiling. Carefully placing the Azure Dragon Emblem back in his chest pocket, he stood up. "Understood, I won't neglect my training. I'll be going now."

"The Azure Dragon Academy will be very different when you return," Noh Goonsang declared cheekily.

"Hoho, I look forward to it."

Bowing, Gongson Su turned and left the Principal's office.

Years later, this legendary student would return to the Azure Dragon Academy, but that is a story for another time.

"It really is goodbye now," Gongson Su said as he exchanged final farewells with Baek Suryong on the outskirts of Nanchang. "Aren't you getting in trouble because of me? All the teachers must be swamped with work after the entrance ceremony."

While Gongson Su had submitted his withdrawal letter right after the ceremony, the other freshmen were busy with their new class assignments. Baek Suryong, a new instructor, should have been running around frantically helping them, yet here he was, leisurely seeing Gongson Su off.

Baek Suryong flashed a grin. "I got permission from Principal Noh. It's kind of nice to play hooky while everyone else is busy."

"Tsk tsk. Aren't you worried the other instructors will resent you for this?"

"They'll resent me whether or not I do this, so why bother?" Baek Suryong laughed, recalling Namgoong Su's sour expression. 

aggAnnoy17

*Which class should I swipe from him? Heheh...*

Since Wiji Cheon was the top student, Baek Suryong had won their bet and earned the right to teach one of Namgoong Su's classes for the semester. 

*Weaponry? Outer arts? Inner arts? Maybe a common class for all grades would work best...*

All of Namgoong Su's classes were popular, so any choice was a good one. Baek Suryong hadn't decided yet, but it was a fun dilemma to have.

"Looking at that smirk, I'd say you're plotting another way to torment the students," Gongson Su remarked.

"It's a shame you won't be here to see it, Elder," Baek Suryong shrugged.

Gongson Su smiled. Had he heard that hours earlier, it might have stung, but now he had new plans. "I'll take those classes when I return, so don't get yourself fired and stick around at the Azure Dragon Academy for a long time," he said.

"I'll do my best."

aggAnnoy01

Right now, they were alone. Wiji Cheon had to remain at the academy for freshman activities, Hyonwon Kang was too ill to travel this far, and Shadow had been dispatched to fetch Skysword, who would arrive with the Royal Guard within the hour.

"So, what was it you wanted to discuss, sending Shadow ahead?" Gongson Su asked.

"I just wanted to chat a bit before you leave. Shall we sit over there?" Baek Suryong suggested, pointing to a small pavilion at the beginning of a mountain path that functioned as a resting spot.

As the two men sat across from each other, Baek Suryong pulled out a bottle of expensive baijiu[^1] he'd bought just yesterday and said, "You've really worked hard this past month."

Gongson Su's eyes widened in shock. "You're sharing your liquor with me? You never let me near it before."

"I got it just for today. A farewell drink won't hurt, right?"

Gongson Su's eyes sparkled. "Sure, there's no one to scold me now. Oh, is this why you sent Shadow ahead?"

"Partly," Baek Suryong chuckled.

Like two mischievous kids, they began passing drinks back and forth.

"This is good," Gongson Su exclaimed.

"Well, it's pricey stuff," Baek Suryong replied.

They didn't need many words. Their memories served as snacks, and the cool, comfortable breeze was their entertainment.

After a while, Gongson Su solemnly said, "Instructor."

aggAnnoy11

"Yes?"

"Keep an eye on Cheon. He's got a gentle heart, and those jealous of his talent might try to cause trouble."

"I will."

"And Kang, he's loyal and upright but quick to anger. Discipline him when needed but don't go too far."

"Understood."

Baek Suryong listened intently. As the emperor's mentor, Gongson Su was unmatched in his wisdom and teaching of virtue and etiquette.

"I pray that Kang doesn't suffer any long-term effects."

"Don't worry, he's tough. He'll bounce right back before you know it."

Gongson Su refilled Baek Suryong's cup. "Ever thought about getting married?" he suddenly asked.

Baek Suryong spat out his drink. "Cough cough! Me? Married?"

Realizing who Gongson Su was hinting at, he quickly said, "No, no, I haven't even thought about it."

aggAnnoy12

"My darling Shadow isn't a bad girl, you know."

"Have you asked her what she thinks?"

It was meant as a denial, but Gongson Su's eyes twinkled, seeing an opening. "So you wouldn't completely rule it out if she liked you?"

"No..."

"I'm serious. Think about it."

"......" Baek Suryong fell silent. He had never planned to get married; he was content just to survive.

*But that was my past life. What about now?*

The world was more peaceful now than it had been fifty years ago. The Blood Cult was destroyed, and the unorthodox sects had weakened significantly. Nevertheless, Baek Suryong knew this peace was fragile.

*The Blood Cult isn't gone yet.*

He had seen signs of their resurgence. They might have grown even more powerful and could strike anytime. If they did...

aggAnnoy05

"I'm sorry, but I'm not ready for marriage."

"I see. If it's you, you must have a reason for that."

Gongson Su didn't press further or delve into Baek Suryong's past. They chatted until the bottle was empty.

"Out of wine already? Did you only bring one bottle?"

"This is just right. Besides, we have a guest."

"A guest? Is Skysword here already?"

Baek Suryong smiled, looking past Gongson Su. 

Gongson Su turned to see a familiar face approaching. "Senior Wonkang?" he gasped in disbelief.

Hyonwon Kang slowly hobbled toward them, waving in greeting.

Gongson Su immediately stood up to greet him. "What are you doing here, Senior? You're not well..."

Hyonwon Kang scratched his head sheepishly. "I got tired of the physician's nagging. Besides, I have a gift for you."

aggAnnoy20

"A gift?" Gongson Su's voice cracked, feeling moved. *Such a thoughtful guy… even though he's injured…*

"What gift?" he asked.

"Haha, I can't wait to give it to you," Hyonwon Kang said, pulling out a small, black dagger and thrusting it towards Gongson Su's throat.

"Oho…?" Gongson Su sensed no malice. The dagger moved smoothly, almost like a gift rather than an attack.

CLANG!

The blade was deflected, and Hyonwon Kang quickly retreated, his face expressionless.

"W-Why..." Gongson Su blurted out, shocked and afraid. Only now did he realize the danger he had been in. "Why are you trying to kill me?"

"Elder, calm down," Baek Suryong reassured, stepping forward after having deflected the attack. "That's not Hyonwon Kang."

"What?"

Hyonwon Kang's face twisted into a sinister smile. "How did you know? I mimicked all of the boy's mannerisms, even his scent, perfectly," the Deathshroud assassin known as Seventh Shroud asked.

"I was expecting you," Baek Suryong replied, smiling icily.
