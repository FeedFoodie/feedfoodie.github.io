"So that's how it ended," Baek Suryong wrapped up his story about the meeting with the principal with his three new colleagues in the staff lounge.

Myeong Il'oh sighed, "Phew..."

"At least it turned out okay," Ak Yeonho remarked, looking visibly relieved.

"Turned out okay? I think it just got more complicated," Jaegal Soyeong retorted, blinking her big doe eyes as she challenged Ak Yeonho's overly optimistic outlook.

Scratching his head, Ak Yeonho asked perplexedly, "Isn't it enough that Baek-hyung wasn't sacked? And Pung Jinho is on the sidelines for now, no?"

"He may be lying low for now, but he's definitely plotting something nasty. Pung Jinho is not one to give up easily," Myeong Il'oh pitched in, shaking his head in disapproval.

Baek Suryong gave Myeong Il'oh a reassuring pat on the shoulder. "Thanks for your concern, but let's put that annoying stuff aside for today. Drinks are on me tonight."

The group stared at him skeptically.

"Drinks, huh? I suppose tea counts as a drink..."

Noticing the disapproving glances of some of her colleagues, Jaegal Soyeong whispered, "You know, the tension around the academy is pretty thick because of the fight between you and Pung Jinho. Even the other teachers..."

"…Have all marked us now."

The trio—Ak Yeonho, Myeong Il'oh, and Jaegal Soyeong—were inseparable even outside of work hours, earning them a reputation as 'Baek Suryong's faction'. In other words, they weren't exactly well-liked by the other staff.

"You two really don't have anything to worry about," Myeong Il'oh murmured, fiddling with his teacup. Jaegal Soyeong was from the illustrious Jaegal Clan, and Ak Yeonho from the formidable Shandong Ak Clan. As no one dared to cross members of the Five Great Clans or their equivalents, they were safe.

*But my situation is different...* Myeong Il'oh, from a less prestigious family, was the most vulnerable and was often ridiculed and treated with contempt by the Namgoong Su faction.

Baek Suryong patted him again, "Il'oh, don't worry. Once we get rid of Pung Jinho and the other trash, we'll secure our rightful place here."

At Baek Suryong's confident tone, a faint smile spread across Myeong Il'oh's face. "Understood. But what are those documents you're holding, Hyung-nim?"

Baek Suryong placed a thick stack of papers on the table, attracting everyone's attention. "This is information about the students I'll be teaching."

Intrigued, the newbie instructor trio leaned in to see the names.

Ak Yeonho pointed at one name. "Ya Suhyeok?"

"Remember the freshman who looks like a big black bear?"

"Oh, right. The giant kid..."

Though he had lost the duel exam to a Student Council senior, Ya Suhyeok's tenacity had made quite an impression on all the watching instructors.

"With the right guidance, especially in the outer arts, he'll become a master in no time," Baek Suryong asserted confidently.

The others nodded in agreement, then shifted their attention to the two remaining names on the list.

Puzzled, Jaegal Soyeong asked, "Geo Sangwoong? Yeo Min? Who are they? I've never heard of them."

"Geo Sangwoong is a fourth year and Yeo Min is a second year. They are both members of the Remedial Class. If Hyonwon Kang is the worst delinquent in the third year, then these two are his counterparts in their respective years," Baek Suryong explained, smirking.

aggAnnoy19

The Remedial Class, which had been practically defunct until recently when Baek Suryong was appointed as the homeroom teacher, consisted of the Azure Dragon Academy's problem students and misfits. The documents Tang Soso provided Baek Suryong contained detailed profiles of these problem students.

"Hyonwon Kang times two..."

"They must be quite the challenge."

Baek Suryong's colleagues shook their heads in dismay. Until now, no teacher had effectively managed the academy's delinquents, thus defeating the purpose of the Remedial Class. However, Baek Suryong was determined to change that.

"Prepare to see a lot of them. I'm planning to include them in my classes," Baek Suryong added, his mad grin undiminished.

Pity filled his friends' eyes. *Good luck, kids... Just don't drop out... They'll be fine, right?*

"Huh?" Jaegal Soyeong's eyes widened as she scanned the Remedial Class students' profiles. "Gambling addiction? Binge eating disorder? Kleptomania?"

aggAnnoy07

Such issues were rarely associated with teenagers.

"For delinquents, this is mild." Baek Suryong nodded casually, reminiscing about the fun times he'd had dealing with Blood Cult prodigies after they'd committed heinous crimes like mass murder and arson.

His friends, however, were taken aback.

"Your idea of mild is kind of... extreme."

"Gambling and theft would get them expelled in any other school."

"Those two make Hyonwon Kang seem like a good boy."

Baek Suryong took the student profiles back, saying, "Anyway, these three will fill the minimum needed for my class."

Defense Against the Unorthodox Arts was Baek Suryong's first class, and he didn't want to just fill the class and lecture the kids—he aimed to properly educate his students.

aggAnnoy17

*Tang Soso's intel is unexpectedly useful. Thanks to it, I've already mapped out my recruitment strategy for each punk.*

Checking the time, Baek Suryong stood. "Lunch break's over. Let's move."

"Ugh, I don't want to work..."

"I want to go home..."

"I miss my mom..."

The four packed up and left the lounge to return to their respective duties.

As they went their separate ways, Myeong Il'oh trailed behind Baek Suryong for a bit. "Hyung-nim," he suddenly called out.

"Hmm?"

"About your class... Have you chosen an assistant instructor yet?"

aggAnnoy08

"Oh, that."

Lectures at the Azure Dragon Academy typically involved assistant instructors to manage the often chaotic and sometimes violent classes. These assistants were usually temporary teachers, senior students, or, on occasion, outsiders.

Myeong Il'oh offered, "If you let me help, I'll give it my all."

"I'm sorry, but I already have someone else in mind," Baek Suryong replied apologetically. Although he understood his friend's plight, he had already chosen someone else for the position.

"I see..." Myeong Il'oh's expression fell for a moment, then brightened. "It's okay. You should work with whoever you think is best for your first class."

"Thank you for being so understanding. We should go out for drinks some time."

aggAnnoy16

"Sounds good." Feeling awkward, Myeong Il'oh quickly changed the subject, "So which student will you recruit first? None of the kids in the Remedial Class seem easy to deal with."

Baek Suryong grinned. "Who says there's no easy one? There's one guy whose name is not on the list, but hasn't signed up for my class yet."

"Oh, right... That name was missing." Myeong Il'oh nodded, knowing exactly who Baek Suryong was referring to.

That evening, the door to the Azure Dragon Academy's administration office swung open, and two figures walked in, bickering.

"Ah, don't pull my ear! I'm coming!"

"Trying to run away, are you? Move!"

aggAnnoy01

Baek Suryong entered first, pulling a kicking and screaming Hyonwon Kang by the ear.

"Ow! I said I'm going! I was just about to register for the class after this!"

Too bad Hyonwon Kang's protests were ignored.

"As if. I knew you'd try to avoid me until the registration deadline."

"Well, uh..." Caught off guard, Hyonwon Kang stumbled over his words.

aggAnnoy13

"Getting tortured at the White Dragon Manor is bad enough. Why do I have to suffer at school too?" Hyonwon Kang muttered under his breath.

Baek Suryong dragged him to the registration desk. "We're here to sign this guy up for Defense Against the Unorthodox Arts," he told the secretary.

Baek Suryong then filled out most of the application form. The only thing left was for Hyonwon Kang to stamp his personal seal on it. 

Hyonwon Kang stared at the form in dismay. "Fuck my life..."

"You look like you're about to sign a contract with a loan shark. Now stamp it before I beat you up and make you stamp it anyway."

Laughter echoed from the other students in the administration office.

"You think this is funny?" Hyonwon Kang glared at them, draining the color from their faces. Then, turning back to Baek Suryong, he pleaded, "Honorable sir, I'm a third year. Can't you at least let me preserve my dignity in front of the juniors?"

BONK!

Smacking Hyonwon Kang on the back of the head, Baek Suryong sneered, "Dignity? Thugs have dignity?"

"Ugh..." Hyonwon Kang groaned, rubbing the bump on his head.

After completing the registration, the two of them left the office together.

"By the way, are you close to Geo Sangwoong?" Baek Suryong asked casually as they walked.

"We used to hang out, but not much these days."

aggAnnoy20

"Why not? Aren't you both delinquents?"

"He was okay until his second year. Now he's just... weird."

Baek Suryong didn't press further, instead mentioning absentmindedly, "I went to his dorm room, but he wasn't there."

Hyonwon Kang looked up at the sky and estimated the time. "He's probably at the gambling den," he replied.

Baek Suryong recalled the notes about Geo Sangwoong's gambling addiction and binge eating habit. Even though Tang Soso's information was detailed, he preferred to judge people on his own terms.

*I'll see for myself what kind of person Geo Sangwoong is.*

He put his arm around Hyonwon Kang's shoulder. "Lead the way to the gambling den, delinquent."

"I'm not a delinquent anymore..."

"Then you know where it is?"

"...Yeah."

With a mixture of reluctance and familiarity, Hyonwon Kang guided Baek Suryong to the gambling den.
