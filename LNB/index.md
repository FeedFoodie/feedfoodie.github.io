For decades, the brave warriors of the Northern Army fought to keep the world safe from the evil Silent Night. But when the fourth-generation leader, Jin Kwan-Ho is accused of colluding with the enemy, he is forced to disband the sect and commit suicide to protect his son, Jin Mu-Won. With no family and allies left, Mu-Won leads a dreary life under close surveillance... until a surprise attack from the Silent Night gives him a chance to escape to the mountains.

There, the young warrior trains to master the fighting techniques of his predecessors, before the mysterious disappearance of a loved one brings him back to the mainland. Follow Jin Mu-Won as he embarks on a journey to avenge his father’s death and take down the villains who threaten to plunge the world into darkness!

## Raws

Please buy the official versions to support Woo-Gak, the author and Hae-Min, the artist. I understand that most of you won't have a Korean ID and credit card to buy the raws (I don't either), but you can support them by buying the English translations on Tappytoon even if their translations are inferior to the unofficial folks. Alternatively, if you live in Asia and can buy China's QQ credits then the official Chinese translation is actually good enough to be worth paying for.
