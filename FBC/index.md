## Synopsis

Not long after Jung Yeonsin was born, an elf physician examined him.

"I'm sorry, but he won't live past twenty," the elf said. "Never in my life have I seen someone with such a dilated Baihui Acupoint. It's like there's a large hole in his head. We call this disease 'Sudden Celestial Ascension'."

"Celestial Ascension? Isn't that when a highly skilled Taoist ascends to the heavens?" Jung Yeonsin's father asked.

"Celestial Ascension is just a myth. When a martial master absorbs too much of nature's energy, the pressure build-up will cause their bodies to explode, sending them across the river to the afterlife."

☆☆☆

This is the story of country bumpkin Jung Yeonsin, who was born with a terminal illness that also makes him a martial arts genius. Can he find a way to survive?

☆☆☆

"If that child had been born in the Demonic Cult, he would have become the Heavenly Demon. If he had been raised in Shaolin, he would have doubled the Seventy-Two Core Arts. Unfortunately, he was born here, in this remote place, as a hated child. He’ll die young with no way to change his fate. Unless… he awakens to his true potential on his own..."
