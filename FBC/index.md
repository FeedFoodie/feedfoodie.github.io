## Synopsis

Not long after Jeong Yeonsin was born, an elf physician examined him.

"I'm sorry, but he won't live past twenty," the elf said. "Never in my life have I seen someone with such a dilated Baihui Acupoint. It's like there's a large hole in his head. We call this disease 'Sudden Celestial Ascension'."

"Celestial Ascension? Isn't that when a highly skilled Taoist ascends to the heavens?" Jeong Yeonsin's father asked.

"Celestial Ascension is just a myth. When a martial master absorbs too much of nature's energy, the pressure build-up will cause their bodies to explode, sending them across the river to the afterlife."

Unfortunately, he was born here, in this remote place, as a hated child. He’ll die young with no way to change his fate. Unless… he awakens to his true potential on his own..."
