**Nam-Goong Su:** 

- Title: Three Absolutes Sword
- Martial Arts: Lightning Sword
- The current Star Instructor of the Azure Dragon Academy. Baek Su-Ryong’s worst rival, best friend, and fellow sufferer of severe workaholism. Has an overly serious and judgmental but extremely caring and attentive personality, which is usually overshadowed by his sharp, sarcastic tongue.

**Mae Geuk-Lyom:**

- The Headmaster of the Azure Dragon Academy and Baek Su-Ryong’s maternal grandfather. Loves his daughter and loathes her husband. Appears to be a very strict and stubborn old man on the surface, but…

Starts out as a very upright kid…until he meets Master Baek.

**Tang So-So:**

- Title: Cold-Blooded Poisoner

### Four Supreme Masters (50 years ago)

**Maeng Ho-Ak:**

- Title: Bandit King

- The Bandit King of the Viridian Forest (think Robin Hood and his Merry Men). A giant of a man who unified the 72 Bandit Strongholds into the largest Viridian Forest Bandit Union in history, and dreams of making the Viridian Forest acknowledged as a sect specializing in outer arts. He offered  Number 27 (Baek Su-Ryong) a new home in the Viridian Forest when they escaped.

**Hyon-Won Hu:**

- Title: Crazy Demon
- Martial Arts: Asura Dark Heaven Blade, Hyon-Won Clan Heaven Shattering Blade
- Once a famed hero and genius of the Hyon-Won Clan, he got himself into trouble by accidentally killing some of his opponents during his Hundred Duels Trial to perfect his unique martial art, the Asura Dark Heaven Blade. Later on, he was framed for the genocide of his own clan by the Blood Cult and had his title changed from the Heaven Shattering Blade to the Crazy Demon.

**Mo-Yong Hon:**

- Title: Sword Saint
- Martial Arts: Unparalleled Sword
- The greatest swordmaster of the Mo-Yong Clan who left the clan after his only son was bullied and ostracized by his relatives. He wished to live in peace with his son, however, his son was kidnapped by the Blood Cult and used as a hostage to lure him into giving himself in. Probably the strongest member of the Four Supreme Masters.

**Eun Ye-Rin:**

- Title: Ice Moon Goddess
- Martial Arts: New Moon’s White Ice Dance, White Ice Divine Art
- The runaway former successor of the North Sea Ice Palace who fell in love with a book store owner in the Central Plains. The Blood Cult made use of her relationship to capture and restrain her. Until her last breath, she dreamed of escaping from the prisons and finally marrying her lover.



### Others

- Our protagonist’s dad. Loves his son to death and would do anything for him. Thirty years ago, when he was a student at the Azure Dragon Academy, he fell in love with Headmaster Mae Geuk-Lyom’s terminally ill daughter Mae Yak-Bing. Due to Mae Geuk-Lyom’s objection to the worst delinquent in academy history getting hitched with his daughter, however, he was forced to elope with her. In the following years, his guilt at his helplessness would pile up as his wife passed away after giving birth, and his son inherited his wife’s illness. After losing to his son in a duel though, he finally lets go of his past and moves on…though the father-in-law problem is yet to be resolved.



### Blood Cult

**Four Kids:**
