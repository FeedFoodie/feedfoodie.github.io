Thirty years ago, when he was a student at the Azure Dragon Academy, he fell in love with Headmaster Mae Geuk-Lyom’s terminally ill daughter Mae Yak-Bing. Due to Mae Geuk-Lyom’s objection to the worst delinquent in academy history getting hitched with his daughter, however, he was forced to elope with her. In the following years, his guilt at his helplessness would pile up as his wife passed away after giving birth, and his son inherited his wife’s illness. After losing to his son in a duel though, he finally lets go of his past and moves on…though the father-in-law problem is yet to be resolved.

Hired Baek Su-Ryong to kill his grandson, who was suffering from Qi Deviation as a result of practicing a fake martial art.
