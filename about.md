## Credits

We do not have any Patreon pages or tip jars for people to donate to! We run this translation purely as volunteers and we do not accept any form of monetary assistance due to the possibility of legal and licensing issues and the pressure that comes with monetary gain. We are also not monetizing this site in any way! We have not put any ads in here! Instead of asking to donate to us, please buy the official version of the manhwa and novel if you can afford to do so! The links for the raws and everything else is put up on this page. Check it out!

## Translator

FoodieMonster007 is a bored translator who has translated various novels for fun since 2010. FoodieMonster007 is very into food. FoodieMonster007 works full-time and sometimes overtime so please don't ask Foodie to translate faster. Foodie also often has to answer to the wifeâ€™s demands and only has so much free time.

## Proofreader

TheGreatT20 is just a random dude who really likes the Northern Blade series and has been helping out with the community around the series and the wiki for the past year or so! I have always wanted to do a proper translation of the series and when FoodieMonster007 reached out to me with a translation, I readily agreed! I guess I am just hyped for a proper translation of this amazing novel! All thanks to FoodieMonster007!

Remember to share this translation if you like our work!
