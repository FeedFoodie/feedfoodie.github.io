Wang Xiaoshi, a kind-hearted young swordsman, leaves the mountains to explore the world. As he ventures into the jianghu for the first time, fate brings him into the company of Bai Choufei, Wen Rou, and Su Mengzhen, among others. He forges enduring friendships with them, and amid the shifting dynamics of the jianghu, he comes to understand the loyalty of friends and the complexities of the mundane world, transforming him from a naive youth into a "hero" who can stand his own ground.
