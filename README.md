## How to use aggAnnoy.exe:

1. Download [aggAnnoy.zip](https://northbladetl.com/aggAnnoy.zip)

2. Unpack the zip to get a folder called aggAnnoy

3. Open the folder. You should see a file called "aggAnnoy.exe - Shortcut"

4. Copy the entire proofread chapter text (including the top part, basically ctrl-A, ctrl-C) into notepad and save it as filename.md or filename.txt (replace filename with whatever you want, it doesn't matter).

5. **Note: aggAnnoy.exe will only work properly before you delete the line "published: false"**

6. Run "aggAnnoy.exe - Shortcut". A dialog will pop-up asking you to choose a file.

7. Navigate to the folder where you saved filename.md \/ filename.txt and double-click it or select it and click "open".

8. Open filename.md in notepad. aggAnnoy should have been added randomly.

9. Copy the text in filename into github, replacing all of the original text (ctrl-A, ctrl-V).

10. Delete "published: false" to publish the chapter.

11. Commit to repository to save changes.
