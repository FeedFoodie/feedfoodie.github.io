In the Club Union meeting room, Seonwoo Jin listened intently as his junior, who had been tailing Hyonwon Kang, gave his report.

"Hyonwon Kang saw the big poster we put up at the main gate."

"How did he react?"

"He didn't do anything. He and Baek Suryong stopped to read it for a moment, then he strolled into the academy like it was just another day."

Seonwoo Jin stroked his chin. "That's unexpected. I thought he'd tear down the poster and go on a rampage. Guess he's not the hotheaded thug he used to be"

"He's still Hyonwon Kang, though."

"Yeah, that delinquent will soon lose his temper and start ripping down the posters."

"We've plastered them all over campus, so it'll take him some time to remove them all."

"Well, he deserves it. Does it even make sense that a guy like him is challenging President Seonwoo?"

"Exactly!"

The BRS executives burst out laughing, disparaging Hyonwon Kang while lavishing praise on Seonwoo Jin.

"Hmm..." Half-buried in a luxurious armchair adorned with a tiger pelt, Seonwoo Jin listened to their flattery with a distant expression, lost in thought.

*At least Peng Sahyuk left behind a comfortable throne.*

He had coveted this chair for a long time, and if it weren't for Peng Sahyuk, this seat would have been his ages ago.

When Peng Sahyuk had suddenly announced he was leaving for the Heavenly Martial Academy, no one at the Azure Dragon Academy was more thrilled than Seonwoo Jin. With that untamed beast out of the picture, the Club Union would be his kingdom to rule... If that damned delinquent who didn't know his place hadn't dared to intrude on his domain.

"Hyonwon Kang, that worthless scum," Seonwoo Jin hissed, his voice dripping with contempt. Even then, his polite smile never wavered, giving him an even more unsettling and sinister air.

With a worried expression, one of the BRS executives began, "Erm, President..."

"What? Is there a problem?" Feeling a bit bored with the same old flattery, Seonwoo Jin perked up, intrigued.

"Wouldn't it have been better to leave out the part about Hyonwon Kang trying to rape a female classmate? People will know we're behind it, and if it backfires..."

"How could it backfire?" Seonwoo Jin interrupted, tilting his head as if he didn't understand.

The executive shifted nervously. "Well... because it's baseless slander. The moment someone decides to do a little digging, it'll be exposed as false, and we'll face backlash..."

"True, that could happen." Seonwoo Jin nodded solemnly.

Feeling somewhat reassured, the executive continued, "What I'm saying is, why do we have to stoop so low when you can easily win the election...?"

"Haah..." Seonwoo Jin sighed heavily, cutting off his subordinate's words.

aggAnnoy20

The executive flinched. "I-I'm sorry... Did I overstep?"

"I'd rather you stick to mindlessly flattering me. Stupid advice like that is just irritating."

"......"

Seonwoo Jin's voice turned cold. "Do you really think winning the election is the issue here? Isn't it obvious that I'll win?"

The entire room fell silent. Seonwoo Jin usually maintained a perfect public persona, always wearing a calm smile and carrying himself with impeccable poise. However, in recent years, after engaging in 'various activities' with these executives, he felt no need to hide his true nature around them.

"Come here," Seonwoo Jin beckoned.

The executive hesitantly stood up and walked over, sweat beading on his brow.

aggAnnoy18

Smirking, Seonwoo Jin reached for the blade placed beside his chair and lightly tapped the executive's shoulder with it. "No need to be scared. Think about it. Is there any proof that we made that poster?"

"What? Anyone can tell that we..."

"I asked you if there was any proof."

"N-No, there isn't."

"Then what's the problem? Are you going to go around telling people that we did it?" Seonwoo Jin's tone sharpened as he continued to tap the executive's shoulder with the sheathed blade, applying just enough pressure to unsettle him.

For a martial artist, this was an extremely insulting action, but the executive didn't dare to react. Instead, he bowed his head and stammered, "O-Of course not, sir."

Within the BRS, Seonwoo Jin's authority was absolute. He was the heir of the Seonwoo Clan, famous for its blade techniques, and although not as prestigious as the Five Great Clans, none of the people here were from families or sects superior to the Seonwoo Clan.

Moreover, Seonwoo Jin hadn't dominated the Club Union merely by leveraging his family's influence. Over the past three years, even while Peng Sahyuk was the Club Union President, he had secretly built up a loyal following by making the executives owe him favors or by digging up dirt on them.

Everything he did, he did to gradually transform the Club Union into his own personal kingdom.

*Life was simpler when Peng Sahyuk was around.*

*This messed-up hypocrite...*

aggAnnoy08

Some of the executives held a grudge against Seonwoo Jin, but none of them were stupid enough to show it, because if they did, he would turn their lives at the academy into a living hell.

Seonwoo Jin chuckled slyly, "And about the rumor that Hyonwon Kang tried to rape a classmate? All we wrote was that it was a *rumor*. Who needs proof to spread a rumor?"

Feeling like a sinner, the executive bowed deeply. "...I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking clearly."

For a moment, Seonwoo Jin's icy gaze lingered on the executive. All of a sudden, however, he burst out laughing, "Haha, it's alright. Just make sure you do better next time. I've been feeling a bit on edge lately, so I overreacted. My bad."

"T-Thank you."

Seonwoo Jin smirked. On the surface, he appeared to have forgiven the executive, he was already planning to use him as a scapegoat if the posters caused any trouble.

*Well, that probably won't happen.*

The election was already in the bag. Even with the SRS backing the opposition, he had the upper hand. Now, all he cared about was how to humiliate that upstart delinquent, Hyonwon Kang, and get him expelled from the Azure Dragon Academy after the Club Union President election.

Seonwoo Jin rose from his chair, casting a sweeping glance over the Union executives. "Here's the plan. First, we'll drag Hyonwon Kang's name through the mud with these posters. It would probably be enough just to list all the things he's done, but if we can add a few more juicy rumors, that'll be the perfect icing on the cake.

"Next, we'll bolster the opposition against him by dragging in the Student Council, the PTA, the Principal, and the teachers."

Seonwoo Jin planned to escalate the situation. No matter how fervently Hyonwon Kang denied the rumors, people would see him through the lens of his reputation as the academy's worst delinquent. Moreover, while martial arts academies were fairly lenient on brawling, behavior that crossed too many lines couldn't be ignored, especially since the Azure Dragon Academy was an orthodox institution.

aggAnnoy04

He smiled broadly and looked around at the executives. All of them were students who either had their weaknesses discovered by him or were in debt to the Seonwoo Clan. They were the perfect pawns for him to use as he pleased.

"This next part is critical. You're going to provoke the already agitated Hyonwon Kang until he snaps and starts a fight. Ideally, let him cut you a bit or break some bones... but of course, don't go dying on me, okay?" Seonwoo Jin chuckled amusedly, as if asking his underlings to suffer injuries was nothing more than a casual jest.

None of the executives dared to voice any objections.

"Once things escalate to that point, he will definitely be expelled."

"......" The gathered executives gulped nervously, their voices caught in their throats as they trembled under Seonwoo Jin's chilly gaze.

*He'd go that far?*

*What kind of ruthless bastard asks others to sacrifice themselves like it's nothing...?*

*What does he mean, we should let Hyonwon Kang cut us or break some bones? What if someone actually becomes crippled or even dies?*

The executives couldn't help but miss Peng Sahyuk. If the previous President was a tiger who ruled with an iron fist, then Seonwoo Jin was a viper hiding his deadly fangs until it was time to strike. When facing the tiger, one might survive by lowering their head, but if the snake caught them in its grip, its venom would seep through their veins, bringing about a slow, inevitable death.

"Any questions? Other suggestions?" Seonwoo Jin asked, despite knowing full well that the executives wouldn't dare question him.

The executives blindly nodded in agreement.

"What a brilliant strategy!"

"We can finally get rid of that thorn in our side."

aggAnnoy20

"As expected of the President..."

Satisfied with their reactions, Seonwoo Jin chuckled, "Keep spreading the rumors and shaping public opinion. I have a little errand to run."

"Where are you going, sir?"

Seonwoo Jin grinned. "I'm thinking of meeting Pung Jinho."

"Instructor Pung Jinho?"

aggAnnoy16

Even though Pung Jinho wasn't a Star Instructor, everyone recognized the significant influence he held within the academy. His sway over the instructors, in particular, surpassed even that of Namgung Su.

Most importantly, rooted in their shared love of money and power, the Seonwoo Clan maintained good relations with Pung Jinho. Naturally, request to sabotage Hyonwon Kang would begin with him.

"I have a simple favor to ask of him. My family has some ties with him, and we get along quite well, too. Oh, and..."

"And...?"

Pung Jinho was only the first pawn in Seonwoo Jin's mind. Thinking of his second target, he said, "After meeting Pung Jinho, I'm going to visit the Student Council President."

"Dokgo Jun?"

Seonwoo Jin nodded. If the Student Council president, Dokgo Jun, stepped forward to criticize Hyonwon Kang, the delinquent's reputation would inevitably lower further.

"A model student like Dokgo Jun despises people like Hyonwon Kang who act as they please. He'll support me," he replied, as if he knew Dokgo Jun well.

aggAnnoy19

Regrettably though, Seonwoo Jin's curiosity about Dokgo Jun never went beyond analyzing his personality. As a result, he was still blissfully unaware that Dokgo Jun was currently taking the same class as Hyonwon Kang and had even faced a life-and-death ordeal alongside him.

Smiling confidently, Seonwoo Jin added, "After that, I'll drop by the PTA. Three days, no, one day will be enough. I'll destroy that fool."

{sep}

"Are you crazy?"

"...Excuse me?"

Seonwoo Jin was bewildered. For some reason he couldn't quite fathom, Pung Jinho was glaring at him as if he were some kind of filthy bug, and the gifts he had painstakingly prepared remained untouched.

"Are you seriously asking me to help you expel Hyonwon Kang from the academy?"

"Haha, that's not what I meant..." Seonwoo Jin began, trying to convey his meaning indirectly.

However, who was Pung Jinho? He was a cunning old fox who had taught at the Azure Dragon Academy for more than two decades, receiving countless bribes and requests during that time. To him, reading a person's true intentions was a trivial task.

"Do you even know who Hyonwon Kang is?" Pung Jinho interrupted.

"...Isn't he the most notorious delinquent at the academy?"

aggAnnoy05

"Tsk tsk." Pung Jinho clicked his tongue. *Foolish boy. If only you knew what the monster behind Hyonwon Kang is like,* he thought to himself.

Not long ago, Baek Suryong had approached him, adamant that he assist Hyonwon Kang in gaining the qualifications to participate in the Heavenly Martial Festival. At that time, he had attempted to probe Baek Suryong's intentions, only to be met with brutal torment as the madman made the parasite run wild, leaving him writhing in agony.

At the memory of the pain from that time, cold sweat ran down his back.

Pung Jinho waved Seonwoo Jin off dismissively. "Leave. I don't want to risk anyone getting the wrong idea if they catch me spending time with you."

"What?"

"I said get out. Or should I throw you out myself?"

"But..."

Pung Jinho stood up, grabbed Seonwoo Jin, and pushed him out of his office.

Seonwoo Jin immediately protested, "Sir!"

aggAnnoy14

"Don't ever come looking for me again," Pung Jinho warned.

SLAM!

Seonwoo Jin stood in front of Pung Jinho's office, trembling with humiliation. *How dare he treat me like this? Pung Jinho... Just you wait!*

Although something about Pung Jinho's attitude troubled him, his anger was too intense to dwell on it. Turning around, he quickly set off for the Student Council building to find Dokgo Jun.

He was met with yet another surprise.

"So you're the one behind those absurd rumors on the posters," Dokgo Jun remarked sharply, glaring at Seonwoo Jin with contempt.

"...What?" Seonwoo Jin was baffled. *Doesn't Dokgo Jun hate Hyonwon Kang?*

Dokgo Jun chided, "Hyonwon Kang isn't the same as he was before. He's stopped beating people up for no reason, and he's quit drinking. Digging up his past now is just cowardly."

"Hey, Dokgo Jun..."

"I'll forget everything I heard from you today. As for those posters... it would be best if you took them all down. For your own good," Dokgo Jun advised sincerely.

Seonwoo Jin feigned ignorance. "I don't know what you're talking about. Those posters have nothing to do with us."

"......" Dokgo Jun stared at Seonwoo Jin silently, as if pitying him.

Annoyed, Seonwoo Jin shot to his feet. "What's with that face? If you want me to scram, just say it!"

SLAM!

aggAnnoy05

Seonwoo Jin stormed out of the Student Council building, slamming the door behind him. 

Confirming that no one was around, he kicked the wall and fumed, "Hyonwon Kang! How the fuck did that stupid son of a bitch manage to cozy up to the teachers *and* the Student Council?"

Finally, he had begun to realize that something was amiss. The Hyonwon Kang he knew was a reckless fool who acted without regard for the consequences. At best, his only connections were his peers in the Medicinal Cooking Research Society and Baek Suryong.

*Is Baek Suryong helping him? But... he's just a new instructor.*

Baek Suryong's recent rise to fame in the Valley of Evil as the Azure Dragon Hero was impressive, but he'd only been at the academy for less than a year. Common sense dictated that Baek Suryong wouldn't have the connections or resources to help Hyonwon Kang.

"Ugh, what the heck is going on?" he muttered under his breath.

Finally, determined to find answers, Seonwoo Jin decided to head to the PTA. No matter how much of a big shot Hyonwon Kang was, he couldn't possibly have any leverage over the PTA, not with his family background.

However, as he neared the PTA building, he froze in place.

**<Allegations Against Seonwoo Jin, Third-Year Student at the Azure Dragon Academy>**

A large poster greeted him, its title eerily similar to the one he had put up about Hyonwon Kang. Only this time, his own name was on it.

"Pathetic," he scoffed, reading the poster.

Slowly, the blood began to drain from his face.

"H-How..."

On the poster, every underhanded deed he had committed over the past three years as a Club Union executive was laid bare, spelled out with chilling precision.
